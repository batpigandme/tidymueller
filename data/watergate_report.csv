36,Introduction 
37,The Watergate Special Prosecution Force (WSPF) has worked 
38,for 28 months as an independent investigatory and prosecutive 
39,"agency within the Department of Justice. As a result of its work, "
40,judges and juries have applied the criminal sanction to an unpre- 
41,cedented number of high Government officials and to important 
42,business leaders. The Special Prosecutor’s mandate includes the 
43,requirement that he shall report to the public and to Congress about 
44,his activities. 
45,Some of the task lies ahead. Appeals will proceed for probably 
46,two years or more. A few cases have to be completed. But most of 
47,the work of the office is done and most of the staff have finished their 
48,tasks. It now seems appropriate to summarize the completed work 
49,in a comprehensive report. 
50,No group of prosecutors and supporting personnel ever have 
51,labored under greater public scrutiny. Every decision seemed to be 
52,a delicate one and previously uncharted courses frequently had to 
53,be faced. Each action occurred in the midst of a national turmoil 
54,"and, in retrospect, some may be judged in the future as just plain "
55,"wrong. This report seeks not to justify, but to explain. The Congress, "
56,the American people and other law enforcement agencies gave con- 
57,"tinued support to the efforts of this office. A full accounting, within "
58,the confines and strictures that the law properly places upon pros- 
59,"ecutors, is required. "
60,This report contains no facts about alleged criminal activity not 
61,previously disclosed in a public forum. Many public officials saw 
62,the Special Prosecutor as one with special privileges to lay bare what 
63,"witnesses had said and to offer his own, personal conclusions as to "
64,what really happened. Other persons also asserted that President 
65,"Nixon’s pardon, and Congress’ passage in the middle of WSPF’s "
66,"work of a retroactive, 3-year statute of limitations for campaign law "
67,violations (replacing the normal 5-year period for initiating pro- 
68,"secutions) reinforced the propriety of releasing grand jury testimony, "
69,"informants’ allegations, and the confidential assertions of cooperative "
70,witnesses. 
71,"However, for WSPF to make public the evidence it gathered "
72,concerning the former President and others who were not charged 
73,1
74,with criminal offenses would be to add another abuse of power to 
75,those that led to creation of a Special Prosecutor’s office. The Federal 
76,Rules of Criminal Procedure prohibit the disclosure of information 
77,presented to a grand jury except as necessary in the course of criminal 
78,proceedings. 1 The American Bar Association reinforces this stricture 
79,in its Code of Professional Responsibility and limits the circumstances 
80,under which attorneys involved in criminal investigations are free 
81,to make out-of-court statements about the details of their work. 
82,"Most important, in terms of the American constitutional system "
83,"of government, is the notion of fundamental fairness for those who, "
84,"after investigation, have not been charged with any criminal miscon- "
85,duct. This consideration is particularly important for a Special 
86,Prosecutor whose independence considerably reduces his accountabil- 
87,ity and who must be unusually sensitive to possible abuses of his 
88,power. It is a basic axiom of our system of justice that every man is 
89,innocent unless proven guilty after judicial proceedings designed to 
90,protect his rights and to ensure a fair adjudication of the charges 
91,"against him. Where no such charges are brought, it would be irre- "
92,sponsible and unethical for a prosecutor to issue a report suggesting 
93,criminal conduct on the part of an individual who has no effective 
94,means of challenging the allegations against him or of requiring the 
95,prosecutor to establish such charges beyond a reasonable doubt. 
96,The decision to remain within the boundaries placed upon all other 
97,prosecutors is in no sense an absolute bar to public knowledge; 
98,approximately a quarter of a million pages of Watergate facts already 
99,exist for public consumption. This material includes the public hear- 
100,ings and published reports of the Senate Select Committee on Presi- 
101,"dential Campaign Activities and the House Judiciary Committee, "
102,"other existing and forthcoming reports of Congressional committees, "
103,the voluminous records of the criminal trials resulting from WSPF’s 
104,"investigations, evidence obtained in several civil suits, and numerous "
105,books and articles analyzing the events of “Watergate” from a variety 
106,of perspectives. The most significant of such records are listed in a 
107,"bibliography in the appendix to this report. In addition, the Presi- "
108,"dential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act of 1974, if upheld "
109,"by the courts, will provide the public with access to enormous amounts "
110,1 Recorded Presidential conversations were made available to the Special 
111,Prosecutor and the grand jury only for use in the investigation and prosecution 
112,"of criminal charges, not for the purposes of a public report. Since the Supreme "
113,Court in United States v. Nixon ordered the President to supply the tapes only 
114,"for such use, the Special Prosecutor is barred from disclosing any Presidential "
115,materials other than those used in court proceedings. The public’s right of access 
116,"to these materials, along with the former President’s assertion of ownership and "
117,"executive privilege to control their disclosure, is now the subject of litigation "
118,which also restrains release of Presidential materials. 
119,2
120,"of information from the files of the Nixon Administration, including "
121,tape recordings of Presidential conversations. 
122,"Subject to the constraints described above, the following report "
123,attempts to describe accurately and completely the policies and opera- 
124,"tions of the Watergate Special Prosecution Force from May 29, 1973 "
125,to the middle of September 1975. The five chapters of the main report 
126,"contain a narrative of operations, a description of office policies and "
127,"practices in investigative and prosecutive decisions, summaries of "
128,"major investigations, a narrative of relations with the White House "
129,"during the Nixon and Ford Administrations, and observations and "
130,recommendations. The attached appendix contains more detailed 
131,information on the organization of the office; relations with U.S. 
132,"Attorneys, Congressional committees and other law enforcement "
133,agencies; press relations; the office administration and information 
134,system; a chronology; a status report of all court matters; and the 
135,bibliography.

137,Brief History 
138,of the Watergate 
139,Special Prosecution Force 
140,BACKGROUND AND ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE 
141,Agents of the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CRP) broke 
142,into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Water- 
143,"gate office complex on June 17, 1972. The resulting conspiracy, "
144,"burglary, and wiretapping charges produced convictions of seven "
145,men the following January in a trial before Chief Judge John J. Sirica 
146,of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. By that time 
147,various public allegations had created suspicions that high-level 
148,officials of CRP and the Nixon Administration had engaged in a 
149,"variety of illegal activities connected with the 1972 campaign, of which "
150,"the Watergate break-in was only one. As a result, the Senate estab- "
151,"lished its Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, "
152,"chaired by Senator Sam J. Ervin, Jr. "
153,"On March 19, 1973, before the Select Committee hearings started, "
154,"James W. McCord, one of the convicted Watergate burglars, wrote "
155,an explosive letter to Judge Sirica who was to sentence him 4 days 
156,"later. McCord’s letter, revealed in open court, claimed that Govern- "
157,ment witnesses had committed perjury during his trial and that the 
158,trial had failed to identify others involved in the Watergate operation. 
159,"Throughout April, news accounts based on the reopening of the "
160,"criminal investigation, the initial Select Committee inquiries and "
161,press investigations — as well as public statements by the Adminis- 
162,tration — increased public doubt about the conduct of high White 
163,House and campaign officials. These doubts heightened at the end 
164,"of April with the dismissal of the counsel to the President, and the "
165,"resignation of the Attorney General, the acting director of the Federal "
166,"Bureau of Investigation, and two of the President’s closest aides. "
167,Further public concern arose about the desirability of the U.S. 
168,"Attorney’s office continuing its investigation, especially in light of "
169,publicly assumed interference from Justice Department and White 
170,House officials. During his confirmation hearings before the Senate 
171,"Judiciary Committee, the newly designated Attorney General, Elliot "
172,4
173,"Richardson, pledged to appoint an independent special prosecutor to "
174,take over the inquiry. 
175,"With the approval of the Judiciary Committee, Richardson and "
176,"Archibald Cox, his ultimate choice for the post of Special Prosecutor, "
177,"agreed upon the terms of Cox’s charter. The resulting statement, "
178,"entitled “Duties and Responsibilities of the Special Prosecutor,” be- "
179,came part of Department of Justice regulations and defined the 
180,Special Prosecutor’s jurisdiction in these terms: 
181,The Special Prosecutor shall have full authority for investigat- 
182,ing and prosecuting offenses arising out of the unauthorized entry 
183,into Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Water- 
184,"gate, all offenses arising out of the 1972 presidential election for "
185,which the Special Prosecutor deems it necessary and appropriate 
186,"to assume responsibility, allegations involving the President, "
187,"members of the White House staff, or presidential appointees, and "
188,any other matters which he consents to have assigned to him by 
189,the Attorney General. 
190,"Richardson also pledged to Cox adequate funding, complete inde- "
191,"pendence in hiring and supervising his staff, and sole responsibility "
192,for contesting any “executive privilege” or “national security” claims 
193,which might be raised to prevent the acquisition of evidence. Cox could 
194,decide whether to seek grants of immunity (subject to the Attorney 
195,"General’s approval as required by statute), and whether and to what "
196,extent he would inform or consult with the Attorney General about his 
197,work. Richardson further agreed that he would not “countermand or 
198,"interfere with the Special Prosecutor’s decisions or actions,” and that "
199,he could remove Cox from office only for “extraordinary improprie- 
200,"ties.” On May 25, 1973, Cox was sworn in as Special Prosecutor and "
201,the Watergate Special Prosecution Force (WSPF) was officially 
202,established within the Department of Justice. 
203,"MAY 25-OCTOBER 20, 1973 "
204,Richardson had told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cox’s 
205,"jurisdiction would include the Watergate case, the activities of alleged "
206,"political saboteur Donald Segretti, the office burglary of Dr. Lewis "
207,"Fielding, Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist, and illegal activity involving "
208,1972 campaign contributions that Cox chose to investigate. Richardson 
209,"later referred to Cox certain allegations, including possible perjury in "
210,Senate hearings relating to Administration handling of an antitrust 
211,suit against the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation 
212,(ITT). When the Justice Department’s Criminal and Tax Divisions 
213,were conducting any investigations regarding matters related to his 
214,"jurisdiction, they would inform the Special Prosecutor and ascertain "
215,"if he wanted to take responsibility. In addition, after initial discussions "
216,"and inquiries, the Special Prosecutor arranged to use the FBI for "
217,5
218,investigative work and to send investigative requests directly to the 
219,Bureau without transmittal through the Attorney General. 1 
220,One of Cox’s first problems was the possible impact on his work of 
221,"the Senate Select Committee’s televised hearings, which had begun "
222,about a week before he took office. Although the Committee and the 
223,Special Prosecutor’s office were investigating many of the same allega- 
224,"tions about Watergate and other Nixon Administration activities, "
225,each meant to use the information it would gather for a different 
226,"purpose, in accord with its particular responsibilities. The Committee "
227,sought to bring facts before the public in order to propose legislative 
228,remedies for any abuses it might uncover; the Special Prosecutor had 
229,the responsibility of investigating and prosecuting specific criminal 
230,charges. The danger existed that legislative hearings might frustrate 
231,"the criminal proceedings. For example, in order to obtain the testimony "
232,"of several important witnesses, the Committee planned to immunize "
233,"them, thus barring any prosecution that could be shown to be based "
234,"on any direct or indirect use of their Senate testimony. In addition, "
235,the televised hearings might create adverse publicity about potential 
236,"defendants in criminal trials, especially a Watergate trial that then "
237,"seemed likely to begin in a few months. For these reasons, Cox re- "
238,quested that the Committee postpone its hearings; the Committee 
239,quickly rejected this request. 
240,"Before two Committee witnesses were immunized, Cox acted to "
241,reduce the chance that a future criminal case against either of them 
242,would be “tainted” by evidence obtained as a result of their testimony. 
243,He arranged to have the evidence already gathered against each of 
244,them deposited under seal with the District Court before they testi- 
245,"fied at the Committee hearings. And, to minimize possible pretrial "
246,"publicity and ensure maximum fairness to potential defendants, he "
247,sought a court order that the Committee’s grants of immunity be 
248,"conditioned on its holding hearings in executive session, or at least "
249,"without radio and television coverage. However, Judge Sirica con- "
250,cluded that he had no power to issue such an order to a Congressional 
251,"committee, and Cox decided not to appeal the decision, since a pro- "
252,longed conflict with the Committee would have kept both groups from 
253,their investigative work and the likelihood of a successful appeal was 
254,"doubtful. In the end, the continuation of public hearings through the "
255,"summer of 1973, among other benefits, brought to public attention "
256,testimony relating to alleged White House involvement in the Water- 
257,1 Richardson and Cox also made an agreement as to the prosecution of former 
258,Administration officials and others on charges relating to favorable treatment of 
259,financier Robert Yesco in return for a campaign contribution. While the matter 
260,"was within the Special Prosecutor’s jurisdiction, Cox agreed that it should con- "
261,tinue to be handled by the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New 
262,"York, which had conducted the investigation and obtained the indictment in the "
263,"case. Thereafter, WSPF exercised very little supervisory authority over the case. "
264,6
265,gate cover-up and other crimes and thereby helped create for the 
266,Special Prosecutor's investigation a base of public and Congressional 
267,support that did much to force the re-establishment of WSPF after 
268,the President's attempt to abolish it later that year. 
269,This early conflict over the possible harm that the Committee's 
270,televised hearings would inflict on the cover-up investigation soon 
271,"subsided. In other WSPF matters, the Committee's staff had com- "
272,menced its investigation some months before the prosecutors were 
273,appointed and had gathered much information of value to WSPF. 
274,"Most of this information was placed on computer tapes, which the "
275,Committee agreed to provide to the prosectors. 2 WSPF decided to 
276,"undertake a similar computer operation, and arranged to use the same "
277,Library of Congress computer system so that information gathered 
278,from other sources could be cross-referenced with that obtained by 
279,the Committee. 
280,"Meanwhile, Cox was selecting a staff that eventually numbered, "
281,"in permanent positions, 37 attorneys, 16 other professionals, and 32 "
282,supporting personnel by August 1974. 3 The bulk of the investigative 
283,"work was divided among five task forces, each responsible for a broad "
284,area of investigation — the Watergate break-in and cover-up; the 
285,allegations about ITT and possible perjury during 1972 Senate hear- 
286,"ings; the activities of the White House “Plumbers"" group, including "
287,the break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office ; 4 Segretti's activities 
288,"and other alleged campaign “dirty tricks""; and illegal conduct in the "
289,financing of the various Presidential campaigns of 1972. 
290,Assisting and providing support for the task forces were several 
291,other groups. A counsel's office was established to provide legal advice 
292,to the Special Prosecutor and the task forces. An information section 
293,went to work summarizing and cross-indexing the masses of Congres- 
294,"sional and grand jury testimony that had already been gathered, "
295,and creating a filing and reference system that would give any WSPF 
296,investigator access to whatever information was already available 
297,in the area of his inquiry. An office of public affairs handled relations 
298,with the press — an especially sensitive task in view of the dual de- 
299,mands of the First Amendment's free-press guarantees and the right 
300,of a potential defendant to a trial unprejudiced by publicity about 
301,his conduct. An administrative office dealt with the many problems 
302,"of space allocation, payroll, supplies, equipment, clerical help, and "
303,2 While the initial agreement between the Committee and the Special Pros- 
304,"ecutor had covered only information made public at the Committee’s hearings, "
305,the Committee agreed in March 1974 to provide WSPF with computer access to 
306,other information its staff had gathered which had not been disclosed in hearings. 
307,"3 In addition, there were ten temporary employees at that time. "
308,4 This task force also looked into various alleged abuses related to Federal 
309,agencies and later into possible illegal activity in connection with President 
310,Nixon’s tax returns. 
311,7
312,messenger service. The FBI and IRS supplied personnel who worked 
313,"closely with WSPF in some of its investigations, while the Federal "
314,Protective Service provided security services for WSPF’£ offices in a 
315,private building in downtown Washington. 
316,The Assistant U.S. Attorneys who had handled the initial Water- 
317,"gate investigation — Earl Silbert, Seymour Glanzer, and Donald "
318,"Campbell — worked with WSPF until the end of June, when they "
319,returned to the U.S. Attorney’s office for the District of Columbia. 
320,The grand jury that had brought the original Watergate indictment 
321,"in the fall of 1972, and had received new evidence in the spring of "
322,"1973, continued to hear evidence gathered by WSPF in the Watergate "
323,cover-up case. In August a second grand jury was empaneled to hear 
324,"evidence in other cases, and a third grand jury was added in January "
325,1974. Because the original grand jury was so familiar with the Water- 
326,"gate case, special legislation in December 1973 extended its term "
327,beyond the normal 18 months. 
328,As the various task forces were absorbing information already 
329,gathered by other investigators and beginning to interview witnesses 
330,"and bring them before the grand jury, the Senate Select Committee "
331,"continued its hearings. In June, former White House counsel John "
332,Dean gave testimony implicating President Nixon and his closest 
333,"advisors in the Watergate cover-up. On July 16, a former White "
334,House official told the Committee that President Nixon in 1971 had 
335,installed in the White House a taping system designed to record his 
336,meetings and telephone conversations. This revelation opened up 
337,the possibility of obtaining evidence that could resolve the con- 
338,flicting testimony about alleged involvement of Administration 
339,officials in various crimes. 
340,"On July 23, the Special Prosecutor, after unsuccessful attempts "
341,"to obtain such material from the President on a voluntary basis, "
342,"issued a subpoena on behalf of the grand jury for the tapes, "
343,"notes, and memoranda of nine conversations which the available "
344,evidence indicated were relevant and necessary to the investigation. 
345,"The President opposed the subpoena, and appealed Judge Sirica’s "
346,order enforcing it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
347,Columbia Circuit. After first suggesting that Cox and the White 
348,House seek a compromise — which they were unable to do — the ap- 
349,pellate court on October 12 affirmed Judge Sirica’s order with modifi- 
350,cations sought by the Special Prosecutor. The Court directed Judge 
351,Sirica to listen to the tapes to determine whether they contained 
352,"discussions subject to a valid claim of executive privilege, and then "
353,turn over any unprivileged sections of the tapes to the grand jury. 
354,While the litigation over the subpoenaed tapes had delayed the 
355,"Watergate and other WSPF investigations, the prosecutors had made "
356,considerable progress in the first six months of their work. The Water- 
357,8
358,"gate investigation had produced guilty pleas from Fred LaRue, Jeb "
359,"Magruder, and John Dean on charges of conspiracy to obstruct "
360,justice. Donald Segretti had pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy 
361,and distributing campaign literature without properly identifying its 
362,"source, in connection with his “dirty tricks” operation. Egil Krogh, Jr. "
363,had been indicted for lying to the grand jury in prior testimony 
364,regarding the “Plumbers’ ” activities. Three large corporations — 
365,"American Airlines, Goodyear Tire and Rubber, and Minnesota "
366,Mining and Manufacturing — had entered guilty pleas to making 
367,"illegal corporate contributions in the 1972 Presidential election, as "
368,had the responsible officers of two of them. Dwayne Andreas and his 
369,First Interoceanic Corporation had been charged with the same 
370,"offenses. Other investigations had progressed, and were expected to "
371,produce additional indictments and guilty pleas. In the negotiations 
372,"leading to their guilty pleas, Segretti, LaRue, Magruder, and Dean "
373,had agreed to disclose to WSPF what they knew about the Watergate 
374,case and other matters under investigation. 
375,Dean’s guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the prosecutors 
376,"came October 19, the last day for the President to seek Supreme "
377,Court review of the decision ordering him to produce the tapes. 
378,"Instead of asking the Supreme Court to hear the case, he announced "
379,a proposed compromise: Senator John Stennis would listen to the 
380,tapes and review a statement of their contents; if verified by Stennis 
381,the statement would then be given to the Special Prosecutor and the 
382,"grand jury. Under an integral part of the proposal, Cox would agree "
383,not to litigate further with respect to the nine tapes or to seek addi- 
384,tional tapes in the future. 
385,"In a news conference the following day, Cox stated his reasons for "
386,"not accepting the proposal. Edited summaries, he noted, probably "
387,would not be admissible as evidence in court. His agreement not to 
388,seek additional tapes would prevent WSPF from conducting its 
389,investigations thoroughly. And the order to accept the compromise 
390,"terms, he said, was inconsistent with the pledge of independence he "
391,had received from Attorney General Richardson at the time of his 
392,appointment. 
393,"That evening, October 20, the White House announced the events "
394,that came to be known as the “Saturday Night Massacre”: President 
395,Nixon ordered Attorney General Richardson to dismiss Cox for his 
396,refusal to accept the White House proposal; Richardson resigned 
397,"rather than carry out the order, and Deputy Attorney General William "
398,"Ruckelshaus was fired for his refusal to obey; finally, Solicitor General "
399,"Robert Bork, next in seniority at the Justice Department, dismissed "
400,"Cox as Special Prosecutor. Also on White House orders, agents of "
401,"the FBI occupied the offices of WSPF, the Attorney General, and "
402,the Deputy Attorney General in order to prevent the removal of any 
403,"documents. WSPF staff members, gathered in their offices, were "
404,9
405,informed that they would work henceforth as part of the Justice 
406,Department’s Criminal Division. 
407,The events leading to Cox’s dismissal had been foreshadowed by a 
408,number of his contacts with Attorney General Richardson over the 
409,previous months. On several occasions Richardson had asked whether 
410,particular matters Cox appeared to be investigating were under his 
411,jurisdiction and had expressed concern that Cox’s inquiries were 
412,going into areas not contemplated when WSPF was established. 
413,Some of these questions were inherent in the apparent breadth of 
414,"Cox’s charter. Other questions rose from Richardson’s own misgivings, "
415,and those of White House officials. 
416,The actions which Richardson raised in conversation with Cox 
417,included WSPF’s possible inquiry into the financing of President 
418,"Nixon’s two homes, its broad letters to several Federal agencies "
419,"asking their policies and practices in electronic surveillance, the inter- "
420,viewing of a former White House aide who had prepared a controver- 
421,"sial plan for intelligence gathering by the executive branch, investiga- "
422,"tion of wiretaps claimed to be justified by national security, and an "
423,inquiry into the handling of campaign contributions by a close friend 
424,"of the President. In July, because both he and Cox were uneasy about "
425,the prospect of a series of politically motivated referrals to WSPF of 
426,"charges against the President or his Administration, with attendant "
427,"publicity, Richardson had suggested that the Criminal Division "
428,screen all allegations to determine whether they were substantial 
429,and fell within WSPF’s jurisdiction before sending them on to Cox. 
430,Cox quickly rejected this proposal and Richardson did not pursue 
431,"it. In August, citing the concerns of White House officials that Cox "
432,"was reaching beyond his charter, Richardson proposed revising the "
433,Special Prosecuter’s charter to define his jurisdiction with more 
434,"precise limitations, and appointing a special consultant on national "
435,security matters to serve as an expediting intermediary between the 
436,Special Prosecutor and agencies from which he was seeking informa- 
437,tion regarding such matters. Cox felt that it was his own responsibility 
438,"to determine what matters fell within the terms of his existing charter, "
439,and rejected any charter revisions as unnecessary. Cox also disagreed 
440,with the idea of a national security consultant because he saw such an 
441,official as a possible hindrance rather than an aid to obtaining neces- 
442,sary information. 
443,Richardson also informed Cox of White House positions on various 
444,"issues, including the production of evidence in response to the Special "
445,Prosecutor’s requests. Despite their willingness to take independent 
446,positions on such legal issues as executive privilege and national 
447,"security, Richardson and Cox had also made efforts to reach agree- "
448,ment on such issues. During the period just before his resignation and 
449,"Cox’s dismissal, Richardson had made efforts to achieve a compromise "
450,10
451,on the question of the Special Prosecutor's access to the subpoenaed 
452,tapes. 
453,"OCTOBER 20, 1973-AUGUST 9, 1974 "
454,"The “Saturday Night Massacre” did not halt the work of WSPF, "
455,and the prosecutors resumed their grand jury sessions as scheduled 
456,the following Tuesday. Bork placed Assistant Attorney General 
457,"Henry Petersen, head of the Criminal Division, in charge of the in- "
458,vestigations WSPF had been conducting. Both men assured the staff 
459,that its work would continue with the cooperation of the Justice 
460,Department and without interference from the White House. Upon 
461,"WSPF's request, Judge Sirica issued a protective order to limit access "
462,"to, and prevent removal of, WSPF files. Despite their anger over "
463,"Cox's dismissal and their doubts about the future of their office, the "
464,"staff members, in a series of meetings, decided to continue their "
465,work for the time being. 
466,"Nevertheless, the dismissal of Cox and the President's refusal "
467,to produce the subpoenaed tapes provoked what one White House 
468,official called a “firestorm” of public criticism and serious talk of 
469,"impeachment on Capitol Hill. In an abrupt reversal, the President "
470,announced on October 23 that he would comply with the grand jury 
471,subpoena and on October 26 that Bork would appoint a new Special 
472,Prosecutor who would have “total cooperation from the executive 
473,branch.” While the President said he would be unwilling to produce 
474,additional White House tapes or other evidence that he considered 
475,"privileged, he placed no restrictions on the new Special Prosecutor's "
476,authority to seek such evidence through the courts. 
477,"On November 1, the President announced that he would nominate "
478,Senator William B. Saxbe as the new Attorney General. Later that 
479,"day, Acting Attorney General Bork announced his appointment of "
480,"Leon Jaworski as Special Prosecutor. Jaworski, who was sworn into "
481,"office November 5, was assured the same jurisdiction and guarantees "
482,"of independence as Cox, with the additional provision that he could "
483,"be dismissed, or his jurisdiction limited, only with consent of a bi- "
484,partisan group of eight Congressional leaders. Three days after taking 
485,"office, Jaworski told a House subcommittee that the continuity of "
486,WSPF operations had been restored and that the office's staff would 
487,remain intact. 
488,"Meanwhile, a number of bills had been introduced in Congress "
489,to provide for judicial appointment or other safeguards of the inde- 
490,pendence of the Special Prosecutor. In the wake of the “Saturday 
491,"Night Massacre,” many people thought it impossible to assure an "
492,independent investigation by anyone appointed solely by the exe- 
493,cutive branch of Government or subject to dismissal without Con- 
494,11
495,gressional approval. Others including Chief Judge Sirica and some of 
496,"his fellow judges opposed the idea of a court-appointed prosecutor, "
497,and Saxbe testified that he had accepted his nomination only on the 
498,condition that Jaworski’s investigation would remain independent. 
499,Jaworski testified that he would welcome any legislation protecting 
500,"his independence further, but was satisfied with his charter and the "
501,"assurances he had been given. In mid-November, ruling on a civil "
502,"suit that challenged the dismissal of Cox, District Judge Gerhard "
503,"Gesell held that Cox’s firing had been illegal. However, noting that "
504,"Cox had not sought reinstatement, the judge said there was no reason "
505,"to interfere with Jaworski’s tenure. As a result of all these events, "
506,Congress abandoned the idea of establishing a special prosecutor’s 
507,office by legislation. 
508,Less than a week after the President’s attorney had told Judge 
509,Sirica that the nine subpoenaed tapes would be produced for his 
510,"examination, another White House lawyer announced that two of "
511,the conversations for which tapes had been sought had in fact never 
512,"been recorded. Shortly thereafter, during a court inquiry into the "
513,"question of the President’s compliance with the subpoena, White "
514,House lawyers disclosed that the tape of a third conversation con- 
515,tained a substantial “gap” — a humming sound which obliterated 
516,some 18 % minutes of one of the President’s conversations— and that 
517,dictabelts of the President’s recollections of two of the conversations 
518,contained shorter gaps. A panel of experts chosen by White House 
519,and WSPF lawyers reported in January 1974 that the 18%-minute 
520,"gap had been caused by a series of deliberate erasures, and that it "
521,was impossible to retrieve the original conversation. Judge Sirica 
522,"thereupon referred the matter to a grand jury. A lengthy investigation, "
523,"conducted by WSPF and the FBI, concluded that only a small "
524,number of people had had the opportunity to make the erasures but 
525,was unable to fix criminal responsibility on any particular individual 
526,or individuals. 
527,"Meanwhile, the task force investigations continued. By the end "
528,"of 1973, five more corporations — Braniff Airways, Ashland Petroleum "
529,"Gabon Inc., Gulf Oil Corporation, Phillips Petroleum Company, "
530,and Carnation Company — and their responsible officers had pleaded 
531,guilty to making corporate contributions to 1972 Presidential cam- 
532,paigns. Former Presidential aide Dwight Chapin had been indicted 
533,for making false statements to the grand jury in connection with 
534,"Segretti’s activities. Egil Krogh, Jr., former head of the White House "
535,"“Plumbers,” had entered a guilty plea to conspiring to violate the "
536,"rights of Dr. Fielding, whose office had been broken into in a vain "
537,attempt to obtain Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatric records. 
538,The new year brought additional indictments and guilty pleas. 
539,"Herbert Porter, a former aide in the President’s re-election campaign, "
540,pleaded guilty to making false statements in connection with the 
541,12
542,"original investigation of the Watergate ease. Jake Jacobsen, an "
543,attorney who had helped milk producer cooperatives make campaign 
544,"contributions and obtain an increase in milk price supports, was "
545,indicted on charges of making false statements to the grand jury. 
546,"Herbert Kalmbach, the Presidents personal lawyer and an active "
547,"campaign fundraiser, pleaded guilty to a felony violation of the "
548,Federal Corrupt Practices Act in his fund-raising for candidates in 
549,the 1970 Congressional elections and to a charge of promising an 
550,ambassadorship to a campaign contributor. 
551,Efforts to obtain additional recordings and other documents from 
552,"the White House, for use as evidence in various grand jury investiga- "
553,"tions, continued during the winter of 1973-74. For a short period "
554,"after Jaworski took office, the White House offered limited cooperation "
555,by supplying some of the numerous tapes and documents requested 
556,"by WSPF over the past four months. In January, however, the "
557,"President retained as counsel James St. Clair, whose major concern "
558,-appeared to be protecting him against possible impeachment. The 
559,"President stopped his initial cooperation with Jaworski, and WSPF "
560,requests were soon met by unusual delays and claims that some 
561,"materials could not be located. Other materials, the President said, "
562,were unnecessary to the grand jury investigations. To furnish them 
563,would be inconsistent with his constitutional responsibilities. 
564,"During the winter, and again in the late spring of 1974, Jaworski "
565,"met periodically with General Alexander Haig, the President’s chief "
566,"of staff. For the most part, these meetings involved attempts by "
567,Jaworski to persuade Haig that the President shoxild provide WSPF 
568,with materials it was seeking. Haig complained about particular 
569,"actions by WSPF staff members, including their intensive questioning "
570,of White House witnesses in the grand jury and their efforts to have 
571,FBI agents interview White House staff members in connection with 
572,the investigation of the 1834-minute tape gap. 
573,"On March 1, the grand jury returned an indictment in the Water- "
574,gate cover-up case of seven men formerly associated with the White 
575,"House or CUP — Charles Colson, John Ehrlichman, H. R. Haldeman, "
576,"Robert Mardian, John Mitchell, Kenneth Parkinson, and Gordon "
577,"Strachan — on charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and, as "
578,"to some, perjury and false declarations. A week later six men — "
579,"Bernard Barker, Colson, Felipe DeDiego, Ehrlichman, Gordon "
580,"Liddy, and Eugenio Martinez — were indicted for conspiring to "
581,violate Dr. Fielding’s civil rights in connection with the illegal entry 
582,"of his office, and Ehrlichman was charged in addition with making "
583,false statements to the FBI and the grand jury about the case. 
584,The grand jury hearing evidence in the Watergate case concluded 
585,"that President Nixon had been a participant in the cover-up. However, "
586,"after extensive legal research in the office, Jaworski concluded that "
587,it would be improper to indict an incumbent President for such a crime 
588,13
589,591-439 0 - 75 -2 
590,when the House of Representatives’ Judiciary Committee had 
591,"already begun a formal impeachment inquiry. He believed, in addi- "
592,"tion, that such an indictment would be challenged and ultimately "
593,"overturned by the Supreme Court, and that the fruitless litigation "
594,would delay the trial of the seven cover-up defendants and possibly 
595,also temporarily halt the impeachment inquiry. The grand jury then 
596,authorized the Special Prosecutor to name President Nixon as an 
597,unindicted co-conspirator in the cover-up case. Since this finding was 
598,"relevant to the impeachment investigation, WSPF asked the grand "
599,jury to report to the court all of its evidence relating to the President’s 
600,"alleged involvement in the cover-up, with a recommendation that "
601,Judge Sirica forward the report to the House Judiciary Committee. 
602,"The grand jury did so and by order of Judge Sirica, upheld by the "
603,"Court of Appeals, the report was delivered to the Committee on "
604,March 26. 
605,Discussions had been held between Committee attorneys and 
606,WSPF several months before. The prosecutors felt obligated to assist 
607,the Committee to the extent that such assistance was legally proper 
608,"and would not jeopardize WSPF’s investigations. In February, with "
609,"the consent of White House counsel, WSPF had provided the Com- "
610,mittee with a list of tapes and documents it had received from the 
611,"White House, and in March the office supplied a list of those items "
612,requested from White House files but not received. As soon as the 
613,"existence of the grand jury report became public knowledge, the "
614,President’s counsel agreed to supply the Committee with all materials 
615,"that had been supplied to the Special Prosecutor, and he subsequently "
616,"did so. Later in the spring, when the Committee sought access to "
617,"various records under seal of the court, the Special Prosecutor on most "
618,occasions indicated his approval. WSPF’s task force heads also met on 
619,several occasions with Committee attorneys to provide relevant 
620,information. Necessary ground rules protected the secrecy of grand 
621,jury proceedings and the confidentiality of WSPF sources of informa- 
622,tion. The prosecutors suggested what witnesses the Committee should 
623,"interview on what subjects, and what lines of inquiry were likely to "
624,prove fruitless for their purposes. 
625,After months of frustrating efforts to obtain grand jury and trial 
626,"evidence from the White House, including recordings of Presidential "
627,"conversations, Jaworski decided that he would have to resort, as his "
628,"predecessor had, to judicial process. A grand jury subpoena of "
629,March 15 had resulted in the production of campaign contribution 
630,documents from White House files but had not called for Presidential 
631,"tapes. At Jaworski’s request, Judge Sirica issued a trial subpoena on "
632,April 18 in the cover-up case for recordings and documents related to 
633,"64 specified Presidential conversations. Unlike the previous subpoenas, "
634,which had been issued by the grand juries in connection with their 
635,"investigations, this one was issued by the court so that WSPF could "
636,14
637,"prepare adequately for the trial in the Watergate case, then scheduled "
638,to begin early in September. 
639,"On April 30, two days before the date for compliance with the trial "
640,"subpoena, the President released to the public edited transcripts of "
641,some of the recorded conversations which had been subpoenaed by 
642,"both the House Committee and WSPF, claiming that “the ma- "
643,"terials . . . will tell it all.” The next day, he formally refused to provide "
644,the tapes to Judge Sirica contending that some of the materials cov- 
645,"ered by the subpoena were protected by executive privilege, that dis- "
646,"closure would be “contrary to the public interest,” and that the sub- "
647,poena was invalid because the tapes would be inadmissible as evi- 
648,dence. His attorneys filed a motion to quash the subpoena. 
649,Jaworski informed Haig and St. Clair a few days later that im- 
650,minent argument in court by WSPF in an effort to enforce the sub- 
651,poena would require the statement that the President had been named 
652,as an unindicted co-conspirator. Jaworski offered to withdraw the 
653,"subpoena, thus postponing disclosure of the President's status until "
654,"later trial proceedings, if the White House supplied voluntarily 16 "
655,specified tape recordings that WSPF considered crucial. A few days 
656,"later, after listening to the tapes in question, the President sent word "
657,to Jaworski that his proposed compromise was unacceptable. 
658,During ensuing litigation over the White House motion to quash 
659,"the subpoena, the President's counsel asserted that the Special "
660,"Prosecutor, as an employee of the executive branch, lacked authority "
661,to seek evidence from the White House by judicial process. This 
662,renewed the argument used seven months earlier to justify the dis- 
663,missal of Cox. In accordance with a promise he had made when 
664,"appointed, Jaworski immediately informed the chairmen of the Senate "
665,Judiciary Committee and House Judiciary Committee of the new 
666,"challenge to his independence. By resolution the following day, the "
667,Senate Committee affirmed its support of Jaworski's right to take the 
668,"President to court, and urged Attorney General Saxbe to “use all "
669,reasonable and appropriate means to guarantee the independence” 
670,"of the Special Prosecutor. Two days later, Saxbe promised the Com- "
671,mittee that he would support WSPF’s independence. 
672,"On May 20, Judge Sirica denied the President's motion to quash "
673,and ordered him to comply with the subpoena. After the President's 
674,"lawyers announced their decision to appeal this order, Jaworski "
675,"asked the Supreme Court to consider the matter as soon as possible, "
676,bypassing the Court of Appeals in order to avoid unnecessary 
677,"delays. The Supreme Court agreed to do so, over White House "
678,opposition. 
679,After legal briefs and oral arguments had been scheduled in an 
680,"unusual summer session, the Court ruled unanimously on July 24 "
681,that the President must comply with the subpoena. While recognizing 
682,"for the first time the Constitutional doctrine of executive privilege, "
683,15
684,the Court held that “the generalized assertion of privilege must yield 
685,to the demonstrated specific need for evidence in a pending criminal 
686,trial.” The President announced that he would comply with the Court’s 
687,ruling and with the subpoena. 
688,"In the days that followed, the House Judiciary Committee con- "
689,cluded its inquiry by adopting three articles of impeachment to be 
690,reported to the full House of Representatives for its consideration. 
691,"On August 5, the President released to the public transcripts of "
692,portions of recorded conversations held six days after the Watergate 
693,break-in. His accompanying statement acknowledged that in the 
694,conversations he had ordered steps taken to conceal from the FBI the 
695,"involvement of White House and campaign officials, and he admitted "
696,that he had kept this evidence from his own lawyers and Congres- 
697,"sional supporters. On August 9, in the face of overwhelming support "
698,for impeachment in the House and almost certain conviction in the 
699,"Senate, he resigned the Presidency. "
700,The Special Prosecutor’s efforts to obtain Watergate trial evidence 
701,from President Nixon did not inhibit other WSPF investigations and 
702,prosecutions. A trial jury convicted Dwight Chapin of lying about his 
703,"knowledge of campaign “dirty tricks.” Gordon Liddy, one of the men "
704,"convicted in the original Watergate break-in case, was indicted, tried, "
705,"and convicted of contempt of Congress, for his refusal to testify before "
706,a House committee. The ITT investigations resulted in two con- 
707,victions : former Attorney General Richard Kleindienst pleaded guilty 
708,"to giving inaccurate testimony to a Senate Committee, and Lieutenant "
709,"Governor Ed Reinecke of California, who chose to stand trial, was "
710,convicted of perjury. 
711,Investigations of campaign contribution activity also continued 
712,during the spring and summer of 1974. Diamond International 
713,"Corporation, Northrop Corporation, Lehigh Valley Cooperative "
714,"Farmers, and National By-Products, Inc., all entered guilty pleas to "
715,making illegal campaign contributions. The principal officer of Dia- 
716,"mond, two officers of Lehigh Valley, and two officers of Northrop "
717,pleaded guilty to similar charges. American Ship Building Company 
718,and its chairman George Steinbrenner were indicted for making 
719,"illegal contributions, and Steinbrenner was also charged with con- "
720,spiracy and obstruction of the grand jury’s inquiry. Another official of 
721,American Ship Building acknowledged guilt as an accessory to an 
722,illegal contribution. A jury in New York found John Mitchell and 
723,"Maurice Stans, two former members of President Nixon’s cabinet, "
724,not guilty of charges connected with contributions by financier 
725,"Robert Vesco, and a federal judge in Minnesota acquitted the First "
726,Interoceanic Corporation and Dwayne Andreas of illegal contribution 
727,charges. 
728,The investigation into the campaign activities of Associated Milk 
729,"Producers, Inc. (AMPI) resulted in several prosecutions. Former "
730,16
731,AMPI officials Harold Nelson and David Parr pleaded guilty to 
732,"conspiracy charges, with Nelson also acknowledging his part in a "
733,conspiracy to make an illegal payment to a public official. AMPI 
734,entered a guilty plea to charges of conspiracy and making five cor- 
735,porate contributions. The perjury charge against attorney Jake 
736,"Jacobsen had been dismissed on technical grounds, but he pleaded "
737,guilty to a later charge of making illegal payments to a public official. 
738,The same indictment charged former Treasury Secretary John Connally 
739,with accepting such payments and with conspiracy and perjury. 
740,"Later in the summer of 1974, Norman Sherman and John Valentine "
741,pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting unlawful AMPI contributions. 
742,While WSPF’s subpoena of White House tapes for the Watergate 
743,"trial was pending before Judge Sirica, Judge Gerhard Gesell was hear- "
744,ing pretrial motions in the Fielding break-in case. Because of doubts 
745,about the legal effect of a previous grant of immunity to defendant 
746,"Felipe DeDiego, the judge dismissed the charges against him. Judge "
747,Gesell also ruled against a defense argument that the entry into Dr. 
748,Fielding’s office had been justified by considerations of national 
749,"security. Shortly after this ruling, one of the defendants, former "
750,"White House aide Charles Colson, pleaded guilty to obstructing "
751,justice in the federal criminal case brought against Daniel Ellsberg 
752,after his public release of the Pentagon Papers. Colson admitted that 
753,White House efforts to discredit Ellsberg by public release of deroga- 
754,tory information were intended to interfere with his fair trial. As a 
755,result of this plea and his agreement to disclose what he knew about 
756,"matters under the Special Prosecutor’s jurisdiction, the charges against "
757,Colson in the Watergate case and the original charges against him in 
758,the Fielding break-in case were dropped. The break-in trial began 
759,June 26 and ended July 12 with the convictions of the four remaining 
760,"defendants — Bernard Barker, John Ehrlichman, Gordon Liddy, and "
761,Eugenio Martinez. 
762,"AUGUST 9, 1 974-OCTO BER 1, 1975 "
763,The Nixon resignation presented WSPF with an immediate 
764,question: should the former President be prosecuted as a private 
765,citizen for whatever crimes he might have committed while in office? 
766,"Jaworski, after announcing that he had reached no agreement or "
767,understanding with anyone about the former President’s possible 
768,"prosecution, said he intended to defer a decision on whether to seek "
769,any indictments. The WSPF staff needed time to analyze all the 
770,"relevant factors. But, on September 8, before the Special Prosecutor "
771,"had decided whether to seek an indictment, President Ford pardoned "
772,his predecessor for any and all Federal crimes he might have com- 
773,mitted while President. 
774,17
775,President Nixon's resignation also raised questions of access to 
776,the White House papers and recordings which WSPF needed in its 
777,investigations of possible criminal conduct during his Administration. 
778,President Ford's counsel assured WSPF on August 15 that the former 
779,President's files would be kept in White House custody until their 
780,"ownership had been resolved. However, when he announced the "
781,"pardon September 8, President Ford also revealed an agreement — "
782,made without any prior notice to the Special Prosecutor — giving the 
783,"former President control over access to the files, which would be kept "
784,in a Government installation near the Nixon residence in California. 
785,President Ford based his position on a Justice Department opinion 
786,"that the former President was the legal owner of the materials, and "
787,on his belief that their physical security could be assured by main- 
788,taining them in Government custody. The Special Prosecutor dis- 
789,agreed with the President's view of the situation and suggested that 
790,he might challenge the September 8 agreement in court. Resulting 
791,"discussions among WSPF, Justice Department, and White House "
792,officials produced an agreement whereby the Nixon files would 
793,remain in White House custody pending review of the question of 
794,WSPF's access to them. 
795,"On October 17, the former President filed a lawsuit to compel "
796,enforcement of the September 8 agreement giving him control over 
797,access to his White House files. The court issued a temporary re- 
798,straining order prohibiting access to the materials without the consent 
799,of attorneys for both the former President and President Ford. On 
800,"November 9, based on President Ford's determination that the needs "
801,of justice required direct access to the Nixon files by the Special 
802,"Prosecutor's office, the President's counsel, along with the directors "
803,"of the General Services Administration and the Secret Service, "
804,agreed in writing with the Special Prosecutor on procedures for 
805,direct access by WSPF. The Special Prosecutor’s office then began 
806,discussions with former President Nixon's counsel to obtain his 
807,consent to this agreement. 
808,"Because of the needs of all parties to prepare adequately for trial, "
809,the Watergate cover-up trial was postponed from September 9 to 
810,October 1 pursuant to a suggestion from the Court of Appeals to 
811,Judge Sirica. Doubts about the effect on the prosecution’s case of 
812,grants of immunity to defendant Gordon Strachan led to his severance 
813,"from the trial. 5 On October 12, shortly after the jury had been se- "
814,"questered, Special Prosecutor Jaworski announced that he would "
815,"resign as of October 26, stating that the bulk of the office's work "
816,had been completed. He also announced that he had decided not to 
817,challenge President Ford's pardon of former President Nixon in 
818,5 Charges against Strachan were dismissed on the Special Prosecutor's motion 
819,"March 10, 1975. "
820,18
821,the courts because he did not believe such a challenge would have 
822,any chance of prevailing. Thus WSPF ended its consideration of the 
823,former President as a possible defendant. Jaworski was succeeded 
824,"October 26 by Henry S. Ruth, Jr., who had served as deputy to "
825,both of the previous Special Prosecutors. 
826,"During the months following President Nixon's resignation, WSPF "
827,obtained additional indictments and convictions. George Stein- 
828,brenner and the American Ship Building Company pleaded guilty to 
829,"charges of conspiracy and making an illegal campaign contribution, "
830,and “DKI for '74/' a committee supporting the re-election of Senator 
831,"Daniel Inouye, pleaded guilty to failing to report a contribution "
832,received from Steinbrenner. Guilty pleas for illegal contributions were 
833,"entered by LBC&W, Inc. and its principal officer, Greyhound Cor- "
834,"poration, Ashland Oil, Inc., Ratrie, Robbins, and Schweitzer, Inc. "
835,"and its principal officers, and the principal officer of HMS Electric "
836,"Corporation. Tim Babcock, an executive of Occidental Petroleum, "
837,"Inc. and formerly Governor of Montana, pleaded guilty to making a "
838,campaign contribution in another person's name. Oklahoma lawyer 
839,Stuart Russell and Minnesota lawyer Jack Chestnut were both in- 
840,dicted in connection with milk-producer contribution activities. Jack 
841,"Gleason and Harry Dent, former White House aides, pleaded guilty "
842,to violating the Federal Corrupt Practices Act in their fund-raising 
843,"for the 1970 Congressional elections. Edward Morgan, a former Dep- "
844,"uty Counsel in the White House, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to "
845,defraud the Government in connection with an income tax deduction 
846,taken by former President Nixon. 
847,Most of these actions occurred as the Watergate cover-up trial 
848,was taking place during the autumn of 1974 in Judge Sirica's court- 
849,room. Efforts to obtain former President Nixon's testimony at the 
850,trial were frustrated when three court-appointed physicians reported 
851,that his serious illness prevented his testimony for several months. 
852,"After a three-month trial, defendants Ehrlichman, Haldeman, "
853,"Mardian and Mitchell were found guilty by the jury, and defendant "
854,Parkinson was acquitted. 
855,"Early in 1975, WSPF's staff began a steady reduction as investi- "
856,"gations and prosecutions were completed, but office business con- "
857,tinued through the spring and summer. Los Angeles lawyer Frank 
858,DeMarco and Chicago book dealer and appraiser Ralph Newman 
859,were indicted on conspiracy and other charges related to their roles 
860,in the preparation of former President Nixon's income tax returns. 
861,"Former Secretary of Commerce Maurice Stans, who had headed the "
862,"Finance Committee to Re-Elect the President, pleaded guilty to three "
863,violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act's reporting require- 
864,ments and to two violations of accepting corporate contributions. 
865,Former Treasury Secretary Connally was found not guilty by a jury 
866,"on charges of accepting illegal payments, and the remaining charges "
867,19
868,against him were dismissed. A New York City jury convicted Jack 
869,Chestnut of a felony for aiding and abetting an illegal milk-producer 
870,"contribution 6 and a San Antonio, Texas, jury convicted Stuart "
871,Russell of three felonies for conspiracy and aiding and abetting other 
872,dairy industry contributions. Former Congressman Wendell Wyatt 
873,pleaded guilty to a reporting violation under the Federal Election 
874,Campaign Act. 
875,Discussions with the former President’s counsel about WSPF 
876,access to Nixon Administration tapes and documents resulted in an 
877,understanding that permitted the prosecutors to obtain relevant 
878,"evidence. Beginning in February 1975, with an index prepared by "
879,"Government archivists, the prosecutors designated the particular "
880,files they wanted searched for documents and recordings related to 
881,specified investigations. The file searches were conducted by archivists 
882,under the supervision of President Ford’s counsel; former President 
883,Nixon’s attorney reviewed all requested recordings of Presidential 
884,conversations and provided copies of those which might be pertinent 
885,"to WSPF’s investigations. Between February and June, WSPF "
886,obtained numerous documents and tapes generated in the White 
887,"House during the Nixon Administration. On June 23 and 24, after "
888,"negotiations with the former President’s counsel, several WSPF "
889,attorneys and two members of the grand jury took Nixon’s testimony 
890,under oath near his California residence. 
891,A considerable portion of the prosecutors’ work in 1975 involved 
892,the numerous appeals that followed convictions at trial and other 
893,court actions. Matters on appeal included the convictions in the 1973 
894,"Watergate trial, the later Watergate cover-up trial, the Fielding "
895,"break-in trial, the trials of Dwight Chapin, Ed Reinecke, and Stuart "
896,"Russell, and the sentence imposed on Tim Babcock. The prosecutors "
897,unsuccessfully sought reversal of a court order moving the trials of 
898,Frank DeMarco and Ralph Newman to two separate cities and 
899,intervened in litigation to oppose Mr. Nixon’s contention that the 
900,Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act of 1974 
901,deprived him unconstitutionally of his Presidential papers. The 
902,appellate process in some cases is expected to extend at least through 
903,1976
904,The grand juries which had heard evidence obtained by WSPF 
905,"were dismissed when their terms expired. The first, originally "
906,"empaneled on June 5, 1972, and extended by legislation was dismissed "
907,"on December 4, 1974. After having sat for the standard 18-month "
908,"term, the second was dismissed February 12, 1975, and the third, "
909,"July 3, 1975. "
910,"6 After the WSPF investigation and grand jury indictment, the office of the "
911,United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York conducted the 
912,trial at WSPF’s request. 
913,20
914,Policies and 
915,Procedures for Investigation 
916,and Prosecution 
917,BEGINNING INVESTIGATIONS 
918,The Special Prosecutor's new charter covered a number of matters 
919,already under investigation by other agencies when Archibald Cox 
920,took office in May 1973. The U.S. Attorney's office for the District 
921,of Columbia had been handling the Watergate break-in case and the 
922,cover-up allegations. The Fielding break-in had come to its attention 
923,"in the course of that inquiry, as had possible violations of campaign "
924,financing and reporting laws which it had referred to the Justice 
925,Department's Criminal Division. That Division had also begun 
926,inquiries into possible perjury at the Senate confirmation hearings 
927,of Richard Kleindienst to be Attorney General. The hearings had 
928,been reopened earlier to explore the possible relationship between 
929,the alleged commitment of International Telephone and Telegraph 
930,Corporation to help finance the 1972 Republican convention and the 
931,Justice Department's settlement of an antitrust suit against the 
932,corporation. And a Federal grand jury in the Middle District of 
933,Florida had indicted Donald Segretti on May 4 for criminal acts in his 
934,“dirty tricks” operation. 
935,The creation of WSPF centralized the investigation of these 
936,"related allegations, many of which involved the same individuals, "
937,"into a unified single agency. However, the Special Prosecutor realized "
938,that an undetermined volume of matters not yet investigated would 
939,"also fall within WSPF's jurisdiction. Thus, the office organization "
940,developed into five task forces and the investigative category of each 
941,was sufficiently broad to include assumption of existing investigations 
942,and categories of responsibility in the anticipated general areas of 
943,inquiry. Each task force began its work by giving attention to the 
944,particular matters it had been created to investigate. But as time 
945,passed and additional possible violations of law came to the office's 
946,"attention most of the task forces undertook new inquiries, which in "
947,most cases bore some relation to the matters they had been estab- 
948,lished originally to investigate. 
949,21
950,"The task force initially assigned to look into the Fielding break-in, "
951,"for example, eventually examined numerous allegations against the "
952,“Plumbers” and other White House staff for illegal activities in gen- 
953,erating electronic surveillance and IRS harassment of many citizens. 
954,"In 1974, partly because it had been investigating possible violations "
955,"of law relating to the Internal Revenue Service, it was assigned to "
956,look into possible violations in connection with President Nixon’s 
957,"taxes. The “Dirty Tricks” Task Force, initially assigned the Segretti "
958,"case, eventually investigated many allegations of similar conduct "
959,in connection with the 1972 campaigns of both Republican and 
960,Democratic candidates. The Campaign Contributions Task Force 
961,began its inquiries with a series of allegations about illegal corporate 
962,contributions and quid pro quo relationships between contributions 
963,"and Administration actions, and ultimately came to investigate "
964,hundreds of such allegations. It also undertook the investigation 
965,of charges relating to the campaign activities of Associated Milk 
966,"Producers, Inc. The ITT investigation, which had begun by focusing "
967,on the antitrust settlement and possible perjury at the Kleindienst 
968,"hearings, eventually included other allegations relating to ITT, such "
969,as the Securities and Exchange Commission’s handling of an investi- 
970,gation of the corporation and an Internal Revenue Service ruling on 
971,the merger of ITT and another corporation. The only task force whose 
972,initial responsibilities were not enlarged later was the one handling 
973,"the Watergate cover-up case, although its work came to include "
974,"inquiries into some matters ancillary to that case, such as the 18%- "
975,minute gap in one of the White House tapes. 
976,The information with which WSPF began its investigations came 
977,"from many sources : the original prosecutors’ summary memorandum, "
978,"grand jury and trial testimony, FBI investigative reports, Congres- "
979,"sional hearing transcripts, depositions in civil suits, and newspaper "
980,and magazine articles. How much information each task force received 
981,at its start or at the start of any later investigation depended on how 
982,far investigations by others had progressed; a few matters were well 
983,"developed by the time WSPF began its work, while many others "
984,were unsubstantiated charges. 
985,The Watergate cover-up case had progressed substantially by the 
986,time WSPF took it over. The Assistant U.S. Attorneys who had 
987,originally handled the matter worked with WSPF attorneys on the 
988,investigation and briefed Cox and his staff on their findings. At 
989,"Cox’s request, their files were moved into the Special Prosecutor’s "
990,"office. In its dealings with the original prosecutors, WSPF was faced "
991,with two conflicting needs: to obtain all the information developed 
992,"by their investigation, as well as ensure its aggressive continuity, "
993,and at the same time to avoid any appearance that the Special 
994,"Prosecutor’s investigation was dependent upon theirs, or limited "
995,merely to reviewing their work. The conflict was resolved when the 
996,22
997,original investigators withdrew from the investigation on June 29 and 
998,returned to the U.S. Attorney’s office. During the 1-month transition 
999,"period, WSPF personnel had sat in on their meetings with witnesses "
1000,"and attorneys and their presentations to the grand jury, and all "
1001,decisions in the Watergate investigation had been submitted to Cox 
1002,for his approval. 
1003,"In contrast to the Watergate Task Force, which took over re- "
1004,"sponsibility after substantial investigative work had been done, the "
1005,task force concerned with campaign financing began with about 70 
1006,different matters that appeared suspicious but about which little 
1007,"was known. To an extent greater than in the other task forces, its "
1008,staff had to make difficult choices about which investigations should 
1009,be given priority. The possible illegal acts fell into two broad cate- 
1010,gories: (a) campaign law violations resulting from illegal contributions 
1011,"by corporations and unions, and failure to comply with contribution "
1012,reporting requirements; and (b) bribery and other violations grouped 
1013,"into a so-called quid pro quo category, i.e., allegations of a dependent "
1014,relationship between contributions and Government decisions by the 
1015,Administration. The campaign law allegations had more substance and 
1016,"more initial evidence with which to begin. In addition, since investiga- "
1017,"tion of these would commence with the larger contributions, they also "
1018,would seem to possess the greater potential for a quid pro quo 
1019,relationship. 
1020,"Accordingly, the campaign financing task force focused originally "
1021,on many political contributions shown on various available lists of 
1022,contributors. The task force attorneys realized that few such investi- 
1023,gations had been successful in the past and felt that time demands 
1024,dictated a course that would generate witness cooperation in order 
1025,to break the barrier of prior witness silence. They also knew that 
1026,locating the source of funds that large organizations used for contribu- 
1027,tions might be an impossible task. The Special Prosecutor soon an- 
1028,nounced his policy to afford prosecutorial consideration in the form 
1029,of reduced charges against those illegal contributors who volunteered 
1030,information to WSPF. The subsequent early disclosure by several 
1031,"corporations that they had made such contributions, prompted in "
1032,"part by their awareness that such activity was being investigated, "
1033,helped the task force in its subsequent dealings with witnesses who 
1034,realized that full-scale investigations were actually in progress. 
1035,Eventually the task force was able to investigate several hundred 
1036,"different allegations relating to campaign financing, including quid "
1037,"pro quo matters, although most of the inquiries failed to develop "
1038,evidence that would warrant criminal charges. 
1039,Sometimes facts obtained by WSPF in the course of its own in- 
1040,vestigations or from other sources would point to the possibility of 
1041,criminal conduct in areas either outside WSPF's jurisdiction or periph- 
1042,eral to its chief concerns. The Special Prosecutor’s charter gave him 
1043,23
1044,broad jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute “all offenses arising 
1045,out of the 1972 Presidential election for which the Special Prosecutor 
1046,"deems it necessary and appropriate to assume responsibility, allega- "
1047,"tions involving the President, members of the White House staff, "
1048,"or Presidential appointees,” and other matters. But for WSPF to "
1049,investigate every allegation falling within those terms would have 
1050,"spread the office’s resources too thinly to achieve significant results, "
1051,and it seemed unnecessary for WSPF to look into matters which 
1052,established law-enforcement agencies could handle without apparent 
1053,risk of the higher-level interference which had led to the Special 
1054,"Prosecutor’s appointment. Accordingly, some relatively routine "
1055,matters were referred by mutual agreement to the Criminal Division 
1056,"of the Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Service, or other "
1057,"agencies, after initial inquiries had shown that there was no reason, "
1058,"other than a literal reading of the Special Prosecutor’s charter, for "
1059,WSPF to handle them. 
1060,After an inquiry into the role the FBI had played in the Watergate 
1061,"investigation prior to his appointment, and in order to take advantage "
1062,"of the Bureau’s nationwide organization and facilities, Cox decided "
1063,to request the continued assistance of the Bureau agents who had 
1064,worked on the Watergate case. A decision not to establish his own 
1065,investigative staff was made after Cox had determined that the FBI 
1066,agents doing the day-to-day work in the Watergate case had appar- 
1067,ently done conscientious jobs. The Special Prosecutor agreed with the 
1068,Attorney General that the WSPF requests for investigative help in all 
1069,task force areas would be sent directly to the FBI and the Bureau 
1070,"reports would come directly to WSPF, bypassing the Attorney Gen- "
1071,eral’s office. Although the Bureau was not involved in some of the 
1072,"investigations WSPF conducted, and played a small part in others, "
1073,"its work in still others was extensive, involving in the aggregate 58 "
1074,of its 59 field offices in the United States and several of its “legal 
1075,attache” offices overseas. Some investigative help also came from the 
1076,"Internal Revenue Service, which audited financial records and assigned "
1077,"agents to work with WSPF, primarily on campaign contributions "
1078,matters. 
1079,"At the outset, arrangements were made for the Justice Department "
1080,to bring to WSPF’s attention any information it obtained that might 
1081,"bear on matters under WSPF’s jurisdiction. Later, appropriate ar- "
1082,rangements for disclosure of tax information were made with IRS in 
1083,connection with campaign financing activities. The Senate Select 
1084,Committee made available some of the information its staff had ob- 
1085,tained except that received under grants of immunity from prosecu- 
1086,tion and testimony given in exceutive sessions of the Committee. 
1087,Individual Members of Congress provided information from time to 
1088,time as it was developed in investigations by their staffs or committees. 
1089,"In addition to these official sources, WSPF received numerous letters "
1090,24
1091,"and phone calls from private citizens, many of them anonymous, with "
1092,information they felt bore on matters under its jurisdiction. These 
1093,"unsolicited “tips” ranged widely in value and all received attention, "
1094,but most of them either provided no facts that could be checked or 
1095,"provided facts which, when checked, left no reason to believe a criminal "
1096,offense had been committed. People with actual knowledge of matters 
1097,under investigation usually had to be invited to tell the prosecutors 
1098,"what they knew; not surprisingly, many of those who knew enough "
1099,to provide useful information and realized the value of their knowledge 
1100,were unwilling to come forward because of their own possible involve- 
1101,"ment in criminal or otherwise questionable activities, or because they "
1102,distrusted the prosecutors 7 motives. 
1103,THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS 
1104,"In conducting its investigations, WSPF used most of the ap- "
1105,proaches and techniques commonly used in Federal investigations of 
1106,"“white-collar” and organized crime. These kinds of crime, unlike the "
1107,"“street crimes” which receive more public and official attention, are "
1108,effectively invisible. They involve conspiracies whose facts are known 
1109,"only to their participants, all of whom have good reasons to maintain "
1110,"secrecy; and their individual victims, if any, usually do not realize "
1111,"that they have been victimized. Thus, the information that investiga- "
1112,tors and prosecutors need in such cases must usually come from people 
1113,who were themselves involved in the criminal activities under inquiry. 
1114,Generally this information can come from only three possible sources: 
1115,the statements of insiders or participants who for some reason are 
1116,"willing to disclose their knowledge, documents which corroborate such "
1117,"statements or provide further information, and the fruits of surveil- "
1118,"lance, including court-authorized electronic eavesdropping. The first "
1119,of these sources is especially important because it often leads to the 
1120,"other two. Documents have to be identified, or their meaning ex- "
1121,"plained, by witnesses who must be persuaded to be helpful. Surveil- "
1122,"lance, of course, can be undertaken only when the investigator knows "
1123,"what or whom to watch, and he can normally learn this only from wit- "
1124,nesses or documents; electronic surveillance requires a warrant which 
1125,must be based on such information. 
1126,As an additional characteristic in “white-collar” investigations of 
1127,"Government officials, corporate officers, and others highly placed in "
1128,"organizations, the subjects frequently can “track” the progress of the "
1129,"inquiry. For example, corporate or agency employees interviewed by "
1130,prosecutors are sometimes accompanied by lawyers who represent 
1131,their employers and whose presence may therefore inhibit the witness- 
1132,"es from being cooperative or truthful. In other cases, such employees "
1133,may report back to their supervisors on the interviews. These condi- 
1134,25
1135,tions make it easier for the officials of any organization to tailor their 
1136,"own accounts of events to what they know the prosecutors know, and "
1137,to conceal criminal conduct more effectively if they are so inclined. 
1138,The need for information from “insiders” and the subjects’ ability 
1139,to keep track of the investigations were elements which WSPF cases 
1140,had in common with the “white-collar” and organized crime cases 
1141,other Federal prosecutors handle. But WSPF’s investigations were 
1142,"also affected by conditions that are not ordinarily as significant, if "
1143,"they appear at all, in other cases involving “white-collar” crime. "
1144,— Much of the evidence needed for investigations and prosecutions 
1145,was held by the White House and proved exceedingly difficult to 
1146,obtain. Tapes and documents relating to Presidential conversations 
1147,"were obtained only after extensive litigation, and production of other "
1148,"documents was delayed and uncertain. As a result, in the Watergate "
1149,investigation the prosecutors initially were forced to unravel con- 
1150,flicting statements of witnesses to a greater extent than they would 
1151,"have otherwise, and to devote considerable time to litigation over "
1152,"tape recordings. In other investigations, difficulties in obtaining "
1153,evidence from the White House delayed the full examination of such 
1154,evidence until relatively late in WSPF’s lifetime. Had such evidence 
1155,"been available sooner, some investigations might have been closed "
1156,earlier and others might have resulted in the filing of additional 
1157,"charges. On the other hand, public attention to WSPF’s efforts to "
1158,obtain documents might have made their wholesale destruction less 
1159,"likely. And, of course, the tape recordings of Presidential conversa- "
1160,"tions, when they were finally obtained, were extraordinarily valuable "
1161,as evidence corroborating what witnesses had told the prosecutors. 
1162,— The public importance of most of the matters WSPF investi- 
1163,"gated meant that others, notably committees of Congress and plain- "
1164,"tiffs in civil suits, had interests as strong and legitimate as WSPF’s in "
1165,uncovering the same facts for their own different purposes. Although 
1166,"other criminal investigators and prosecutors, both State and Federal, "
1167,deferred to WSPF in cases where they had been looking into the same 
1168,"matters, this kind of deference could not be expected of Congressional "
1169,"committees and private litigants, whose purposes might be harmed by "
1170,"delaying their own inquiries. In one respect, these parallel inquiries "
1171,"were helpful, as they provided valuable information to the prosecutors, "
1172,"especially as WSPF’s work was beginning. In other respects, they may "
1173,have unavoidably hindered the prosecutors’ inquiries by inhibiting 
1174,some witnesses from telling the prosecutors what they knew. Prior 
1175,public testimony of key witnesses may have helped other witnesses 
1176,and suspects fabricate their own versions of events. Some people may 
1177,have feared that disclosures to WSPF would lead to their being con- 
1178,tacted by other investigators. People who had testified in self-serving 
1179,ways in other forums may have been inhibited from giving WSPF 
1180,more accurate information because of their prior statements. And the 
1181,credibility of prosecution witnesses at trial could sometimes be chal- 
1182,lenged by pointing to inconsistencies in their statements to other 
1183,investigators. 
1184,—The interest of the news media in WSPF’s work and the cases it 
1185,produced created potential problems. Some witnesses may have been 
1186,reluctant to provide information for fear that they would find them- 
1187,selves testifying in a celebrated trial or portrayed in the press as having 
1188,been involved in a major scandal; their chances of remaining anony- 
1189,mous were considerably less than those of most witnesses in more 
1190,"traditional investigations. Furthermore, press attention to WSPF’s "
1191,work created ever-present dangers that errors in the conduct of in- 
1192,"vestigations, including “leaks” of information, might be exploited by "
1193,people who wanted to halt WSPF’s work. There was the additional 
1194,and unusual problem of disclosures by people associated with witnesses 
1195,"and potential defendants, for the purpose of generating publicity for "
1196,tactical advantage or to bring public pressure on WSPF to take a 
1197,"particular action. However, publicity may also have worked to WSPF’s "
1198,advantage insofar as it may have influenced some witnesses to appear 
1199,"cooperative by letting the prosecutors interview them, furnishing office "
1200,"calendars and similar records, and testifying before the grand jury. "
1201,"While at times cooperation was more apparent then real, the access it "
1202,"provided to such people, whose hostility otherwise might have en- "
1203,"gendered a lack of cooperation, did contribute to the resolution of "
1204,matters being investigated. 
1205,"— Unlike most prosecuting agencies, WSPF required continuous "
1206,public support for its work. Political pressures had led to the creation 
1207,"of the office, and other political pressures could destroy it. Its investi- "
1208,"gations jeopardized some of the most powerful people in the country, "
1209,who could be expected to try to protect themselves and their associates 
1210,by publicly challenging and encouraging others to challenge WSPF’s 
1211,impartiality and the motives of the people who were providing in- 
1212,"formation to the prosecutors. For example, the credibility of John "
1213,"Dean, one of the most important witnesses in the Watergate cover-up "
1214,"case, was attacked publicly by high officials during the course of his "
1215,"cooperation with WSPF. The prospect of such denunciation, or simply "
1216,"of incurring the hostility of such powerful people, may have affected "
1217,other witnesses’ decisions about telling the prosecutors what they 
1218,knew. 
1219,The need to retain public support probably made WSPF more cau- 
1220,tious and restrained in its methods than a prosecuting agency would 
1221,"normally be in an investigation. For example, WSPF never used "
1222,"“planted” informants or electronic surveillance, although such tech- "
1223,"niques, often used in “white-collar” and organized crime investigations, "
1224,might have been productive on a few occasions. The use of such tech- 
1225,"niques, though legally proper, might have damaged WSPF’s credibility "
1226,"with the public whose support it needed, since they were at least "
1227,27
1228,superficially comparable with the similar techniques used illegally in 
1229,the criminal conspiracies the office was investigating. 
1230,"As noted above, apart from the significant differences dictated by "
1231,"these unique circumstances, WSPF conducted its investigations in "
1232,ways similar to those used by Federal prosecutors in “white-collar” 
1233,and organized crime cases. Because of the large numbers of people 
1234,"involved and the complexity of the cases, this process is usually far "
1235,more laborious and time-consuming than the investigation of most 
1236,"other types of crime. Thus, while experience, instinct, and luck play "
1237,"a part, such investigations are most often characterized by careful "
1238,"planning, ongoing strategic decisions, persistence, attention to detail, "
1239,"the amassing of large quantities of information, and the investigators’ "
1240,ability to obtain information from people who often have an interest 
1241,"in withholding it. The way in which witnesses are contacted, and their "
1242,"cooperation is sought and maintained, becomes an important factor "
1243,in such cases. 
1244,"WSPF contacts with witnesses, as in most Federal investigations, "
1245,occurred in three basic settings: interviews by agents of the FBI 
1246,"pursuant to WSPF requests for assistance, interviews by attorneys "
1247,"in WSPF’s offices, and grand jury appearances. Which of these vehicles "
1248,was used in any particular instance depended on a variety of possible 
1249,considerations. 
1250,"When a bare allegation was received, showing a possible violation "
1251,"of criminal law but lacking specifics, the FBI was often asked to make "
1252,initial inquiries through the appropriate field office to obtain further 
1253,details; its findings would be used in deciding whether to continue 
1254,the investigation. The FBI was also asked to pursue leads arising from 
1255,"witnesses’ statements to the prosecutors or the grand jury, and to "
1256,seek corroboration of material facts supplied by some witnesses. For 
1257,"example, agents checked telephone, hotel, and airline records to learn "
1258,whether they supported witnesses’ accounts of phone calls and travel. 
1259,"In some cases, the FBI was also asked to provide investigative help "
1260,"between the time of indictment and trial, when prosecutors cannot "
1261,use the grand jury process for investigative purposes. 
1262,"In some nationwide investigations, such as that of dairy industry "
1263,"campaign activities, the initial information available strongly sug- "
1264,gested that criminal activity had occurred and that the participants 
1265,were endeavoring to prevent discovery of the full facts. It was impor- 
1266,"tant that such inquiries be centrally conducted, so that each person "
1267,contacting witnesses would be as fully informed as possible about 
1268,"every document, every witness’ prior statements, and the attitudes "
1269,"and propensities of each potential witness. Here, too, immediate "
1270,follow-up and selective use of the grand jury can become crucial. In 
1271,"such situations, prosecutors normally assume the interrogator’s role, "
1272,with only selective use of another law enforcement agency such as the 
1273,"FBI. It is important for the prosecutor, and perhaps ultimately the "
1274,28
1275,"grand jury, to hear witnesses directly and question them with knowl- "
1276,edge of all information already available. This contrasts with the 
1277,normal FBI procedure of having witnesses interviewed by agents 
1278,stationed in the field offices covering the respective areas where they 
1279,"reside. In addition, the FBI lacks the subpoena power available to the "
1280,"prosecutor through the grand jury. Accordingly, in some of the nation- "
1281,wide inquiries WSPF attorneys interviewed most of the witnesses them- 
1282,"selves rather than asking the FBI to do so. In a few instances, most "
1283,notably the Watergate investigation and the inquiry into the 18% 
1284,"minute tape gap, where most witnesses resided in the Washington "
1285,"area, the same group of FBI agents worked continuously and closely "
1286,with WSPF attorneys who used all available settings for questioning 
1287,witnesses. 
1288,"When the prosecutors learned, from the FBI or other sources, "
1289,facts indicating that a witness might have information relevant to an 
1290,"investigation, they commonly interviewed such a witness in WSPF's "
1291,offices to determine whether the facts warranted further investigation. 
1292,Office interviews were also used in pursuit of investigative leads which 
1293,seemed likely to have value in eventual prosecutions. Another func- 
1294,tion of office interviews was in preparing cooperative witnesses for 
1295,grand jury or trial testimony. Office interviews also had value in 
1296,letting some uncooperative witnesses know how much the prosecutors 
1297,had learned about their activities; this knowdedge might affect their 
1298,attitude towards cooperation. 
1299,"When appropriate, people interviewed by WSPF attorneys were "
1300,informed of their rights in connection with the interview — that they 
1301,"were not required to participate in the interview 7 , that they could end "
1302,"the conversation at any time, and that they could consult a lawyer and "
1303,bring him with them (as most did). These warnings resemble those 
1304,required by the Supreme Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona when 
1305,the police arrest someone suspected of a crime. While the law only 
1306,"requires that such warnings be given in certain situations, the prose- "
1307,cutors generally tried to err on the side of caution by giving the 
1308,warnings even when not legally required to do so. When an investiga- 
1309,"tion had progressed substantially, the warnings were almost always "
1310,given to each witness. 
1311,A witness was called to appear before the grand jury if the prose- 
1312,cutors believed that such an appearance was the most reliable method 
1313,"of obtaining, or attempting to obtain, truthful testimony. Apart from "
1314,the basic purpose of bringing relevant evidence to the grand jury's 
1315,"attention, grand jury appearances produced a verbatim record of the "
1316,witness' sworn testimony which could serve as a basis for further 
1317,"inquiries or could be used, if necessary, to challenge any later incon- "
1318,"sistent statement. In addition, since deliberately false testimony "
1319,"could lead to perjury charges, grand jury witnesses had a strong in- "
1320,centive to be truthful. 
1321,29
1322,591-439 0 - 75 -3 
1323,A grand jury appearance also gave the prosecutors a chance to 
1324,see what kind of impression a witness made on a group of citizens 
1325,"similar to those who would serve on a trial jury — his demeanor, "
1326,"nervousness, certainty or uncertainty of recollection, and general "
1327,credibility. Although most grand jury witnesses appeared at the pros- 
1328,"ecutor's request or under subpoena, others did so at their own request. "
1329,Any potential defendant who wanted to give the grand jury his version 
1330,"of the facts was invited to do so, whether or not the prosecutors would "
1331,have called for his testimony on their own. 
1332,"When appropriate, before giving testimony, grand jury witnesses "
1333,were advised of their rights — to decline to answer any question on 
1334,"grounds of self -incrimination, to have an attorney, and to consult "
1335,with him outside the grand jury room at any time during the question- 
1336,"ing. As in all Federal grand jury proceedings, witnesses were not "
1337,entitled to have their lawyers physically present in the grand jury 
1338,room while testifying. Any grand jury witness who informed the 
1339,prosecutors that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege 
1340,against self-incrimination regarding all substantive questions was 
1341,"excused from testifying, provided that his lawyer informed the "
1342,prosecutors in writing of his position. The grand jury would not be 
1343,informed of the witness' intent to assert his privilege unless its mem- 
1344,bers specifically insisted upon his appearance; this happened rarely. 
1345,The prosecutors worked with some witnesses in all three ways — 
1346,"first having an FBI agent interview them, later interviewing them in "
1347,"WSPF's offices, then questioning them under oath before a grand "
1348,"jury — and with other witnesses in only one or two. Any such contacts, "
1349,"in any investigation, involve a danger of letting the witness, partic- "
1350,"ularly a hostile one, learn what the prosecutors already know and "
1351,what more they want to find out. Thus a witness may obtain more 
1352,information in an interview or grand jury appearance than he pro- 
1353,"vides. If he is a potential defendant or wants to protect one, such "
1354,information can help him fashion a version of the facts which will 
1355,sidetrack the prosecutors' investigation without being so implausible 
1356,"as to raise suspicions. For example, in an office interview the prose- "
1357,cutors might ask a witness what had happened at a particular meeting 
1358,"he had attended. Realizing that they knew of that meeting, the witness "
1359,could feign forgetfulness and avoid telling them anything of value. 
1360,"After the interview, he would be able to “consult his records,"" and "
1361,"perhaps also consult others who had attended the same meeting, and "
1362,concoct an account that would work to his or their advantage. 
1363,Sometimes a witness would decline a request to be interviewed 
1364,or to testify before the grand jury because he believed the information 
1365,he might provide could be used as evidence against him in a later 
1366,"prosecution. Such a situation, which prosecutors commonly face, "
1367,requires a determination whether to give assurances to the witness 
1368,in return for his cooperation. Some witnesses were satisfied merely 
1369,30
1370,to know that the prosecutors did not view them as potential 
1371,defendants and had no present reason to expect to charge them. Others 
1372,insisted on being assured that their statements in office interviews 
1373,"would not be repeated later as direct evidence against them, although "
1374,the witnesses understood that investigation of others based on the 
1375,office statements might result in the obtaining of evidence that 
1376,"could be used against the cooperating witness. In some instances, "
1377,witnesses insisted on what amounted to informal use immunity — a 
1378,promise that neither their statements nor evidence obtained as a 
1379,"result of them would be used against them. And in rare instances, "
1380,witnesses would insist that WSPF apply to the District Court for a 
1381,formal grant of use immunity. 
1382,About 30 of the hundreds of witnesses who were interviewed by 
1383,the prosecutors or testified before the grand jury received complete 
1384,"use immunity, either formal or informal, and only a few of them "
1385,might have been prosecuted otherwise. The prosecutors tried to 
1386,avoid giving such immunity when they could not be sure how their 
1387,"cases would develop. If the assurances given were too broad, a valid "
1388,"future prosecution might be foreclosed; if they were not broad enough, "
1389,valuable information might not be obtained from the witnesses. In 
1390,"many instances, the prosecutors had little basis to choose which of "
1391,these risks to run. In order to determine as accurately as possible 
1392,the appropriateness of making any commitment to a witness who 
1393,"requested one, the prosecutors often followed the common practice "
1394,of asking the witness’ counsel to make an offer of proof — a statement 
1395,in broad hypothetical terms of what the witness would be able to 
1396,tell them. This statement gave them a better basis for deciding 
1397,whether the witness’ information was important enough to their 
1398,overall investigation to justify whatever assurances he was seeking. 
1399,Another reason for the prosecutors’ conservative approach to 
1400,"immunity, particularly as to important Government agency actions, "
1401,"was the irrelevance of the practice, often followed in organized crime "
1402,"cases, of using a person’s rank in an organization as a principal stand- "
1403,"ard in deciding whether to immunize him — for example, giving "
1404,immunity to street-level participants in criminal activity in order to 
1405,"obtain their testimony against the major figures. This practice, which "
1406,"has many variations in individual cases, makes sense in dealing with "
1407,members of continuing hierarchial organizations whose major activity 
1408,is crime. But a “low level” employee in an organization like the White 
1409,House staff is a relative concept — anyone in such a position has a great 
1410,deal of power. It was felt that they should take some responsibilit}Hor 
1411,their actions; “following orders” should not be an absolute defense 
1412,for criminal conduct. 
1413,When a witness seeking immunity appeared to bear major respon- 
1414,"sibility for criminal conduct, and the prosecutors believed they had "
1415,"enough evidence to obtain his conviction, they rejected the choice of "
1416,31
1417,immunity and instead pursued a course of plea bargaining. This 
1418,involved telling the witness the entire range of charges he might 
1419,"some day face, and offering to reduce this total range in return for his "
1420,plea of guilty to an appropriate charge and cooperation with the inves- 
1421,tigators. This course would provide the prosecutors with the guilty 
1422,man’s future testimony and make him more credible as a trial witness 
1423,against other defendants than he would be as a man who had traded 
1424,"his testimony for complete immumity from his own guilt. Moreover, "
1425,plea bargaining is probably a better basis than a grant of immunity 
1426,for assuring that a witness does not fabricate information he thinks 
1427,"the prosecutors “want to hear” in his offer of proof, since he would "
1428,expect the offer to result only in a negotiated guilty plea rather than 
1429,"in his freedom. Most important, it avoided the unfairness of per- "
1430,mitting one guilty of serious misconduct to avoid all liability. 
1431,The use of plea bargaining rather than immunity involved delays 
1432,in some investigations — instead of immunizing a witness and getting 
1433,"his immediate cooperation, the prosecutors had to negotiate with his "
1434,counsel over an appropriate charge to which he would plead guilty 
1435,before his testimony would become available. But the result of the 
1436,practice was that no one whom the prosecutors could prove had 
1437,major responsibility for criminal conduct was immunized on WSPF’s 
1438,initiative. 
1439,"In giving assurance to witnesses in return for their cooperation, "
1440,whether those assurances were limited to the nonuse of their actual 
1441,"statements as evidence against them, or as broad as a formal or "
1442,"informal grant of immunity, or embodied in a plea agreement, the "
1443,prosecutors always reserved the right to cancel the agreement or to 
1444,bring charges of perjury or false statements to criminal investigators 
1445,if a witness lied to them. While witnesses often failed to provide as 
1446,"much evidence as the prosecutors might have expected from them, "
1447,none were charged with such offenses. 
1448,When an investigation resulted in a finding that no criminal 
1449,"activities could be detected, it was closed without the filing of a formal "
1450,memorandum. This occurred most often in the campaign contri- 
1451,butions area where by far the largest number of WSPF’s investiga- 
1452,tions occurred and where the prosecutors started with the least 
1453,information. Where the initial inquiry showed possible criminal 
1454,activity but little promise of successful identification of the particular 
1455,"individuals involved, closing was also at the task force level, some- "
1456,times with the filing of a memorandum indicating the reasons for the 
1457,closing. Copies of such memoranda were sent to the Deputy Special 
1458,"Prosecutor, through whom all investigative requests to other agencies "
1459,had been routed. In task forces that handled relatively few separate 
1460,"investigations, matters showing little promise were normally closed "
1461,"through consultation with the task force leader, the Deputy Special "
1462,"Prosecutor, and on many occasions the Special Prosecutor. No major "
1463,32
1464,matter that had produced significant evidence of criminality short of 
1465,prosecution potential was closed without the approval of the Special 
1466,Prosecutor or his Deputy. A closing was never final; the investigation 
1467,could always be reopened (subject to the statute of limitations) if new 
1468,evidence turned up. But in practice this rarely occurred. 
1469,The day-to-day work in investigations was done within WSPF’s 
1470,five task forces. Each task force leader had considerable discretion in 
1471,"choosing investigative techniques and strategy. Progress, priorities, "
1472,and thoroughness of the task forces were monitored by the Special 
1473,Prosecutor and his Deputy through regular meetings with each task 
1474,force’s lawyers and other meetings with the heads of all task forces. 
1475,These meetings were a means of maintaining communications among 
1476,"task forces, shifting manpower as needs changed, and keeping the "
1477,Special Prosecutor and his Deputy informed of the course of all 
1478,"investigations. In the early months of WSPF’s work, it was routine "
1479,for each task force to inform his colleagues in other task forces of the 
1480,witnesses who were coming in to be interviewed or to appear before 
1481,"the grand jury, so that each investigating attorney who needed to "
1482,talk with a particular witness would have a chance to do so. This kind 
1483,of coordination became less frequent as time passed and the investi- 
1484,"gations became more distinct from one another. However, grand jury "
1485,time continued to be scheduled centrally and decisions about bringing 
1486,charges or accepting plea bargains were cleared with all the task forces 
1487,that had been investigating activities or persons relative to the 
1488,proposed course of action. People who pleaded guilty to charges and 
1489,agreed to disclose to WSPF what they knew about all matters under 
1490,investigation were interviewed by members of each task force to find 
1491,out what they could add to the evidence that each was gathering. 
1492,This coordination process involved serious problems among the task 
1493,forces. Each had its own priorities; each had its demands for witness 
1494,interview timing and precedence; and each relevant investigating 
1495,"group had its own views of the propriety of a proposed immunity, a "
1496,proposed plea of guilty or a proposed initial criminal charge against 
1497,a subject. 
1498,If an investigation led to findings that might form the basis of 
1499,"criminal charges against anyone, the prosecutors continued their "
1500,inquiries with a view to shaping the case they expected to prove 
1501,"against such an individual. This involved obtaining the most accurate, "
1502,"complete, and detailed information they could get on the events "
1503,"which constituted the crime, using counsel’s office for legal research "
1504,"to determine what charges the evidence most clearly described, and "
1505,making a charging decision in consultation with others in the office 
1506,and with the Special Prosecutor’s approval. 
1507,33
1508,CHARGING AND DISPOSING OF CASES 
1509,Fulfilling the prosecutor's obligation to investigate all eases fully 
1510,and fairly requires not only thorough investigation and analysis of the 
1511,"facts, but also the exercise of care and judgment in deciding what, if "
1512,"any, criminal charges should be brought. In deciding whether to bring "
1513,"charges, prosecutors often take a great many factors into account. "
1514,While there were similarities in the processes and criteria by which 
1515,the various WSPF task forces made their recommendations and the 
1516,"Special Prosecutor made his decisions, there were also substantial and "
1517,important differences in the ways WSPF handled each of the cases 
1518,"within its jurisdiction. Among other variables, these differences re- "
1519,"sulted from the unique facts of each case, the varying laws applicable "
1520,"to the conduct in question, the nature and quality of the evidence "
1521,"available to the prosecution, and the differing circumstances of each "
1522,potential defendant. To discuss these factors fully would require the 
1523,unfair disclosure of much confidential information obtained during the 
1524,office's investigations. Such disclosure might seriously violate both the 
1525,rights of those who were not charged with any crime and the legal and 
1526,ethical obligations of prosecutors to protect the rights of the accused. 
1527,"Hence, it must be noted that the discussions of investigating, charging, "
1528,"prosecuting, and plea-bargaining practices contained in this report "
1529,can in no sense be interpreted as applying fully to any single case or 
1530,describing completely the way a particular case was handled by 
1531,"WSPF. More to the point, they cannot be considered as statements of "
1532,"uniform policy on the part of WSPF, the Department of Justice, or "
1533,any other prosecuting entity. 
1534,"The initiative for criminal charges in “white-collar"" cases typically "
1535,comes from prosecutors rather than from victims making complaints. 
1536,"During and after the evidence-gathering process, the decision normally "
1537,involves legal research into the applicability of particular criminal 
1538,statutes to the facts and the development of a theory of the case to 
1539,determine which violations are most clearly demorstrated by the evi- 
1540,dence and what kind of additional evidence is required. The office 
1541,review undertaken before seeking an indictment in the Fielding break- 
1542,in case provides an example of this process. The evidence showed that 
1543,"the potential defendants had authorized, planned, and conducted a "
1544,surreptitious entry into Dr. Fielding’s California office in an effort to 
1545,"photograph psychiatric records of Daniel Ellsberg, his former patient, "
1546,who was then facing charges in connection with the disclosure of the 
1547,"“Pentagon Papers."" This break-in, the evidence indicated, was part "
1548,of a larger plan to damage Ellsberg's reputation by obtaining and 
1549,"releasing derogatory information about him. However, deciding on the "
1550,proper charge proved no easy matter. 
1551,"Although these acts obviously constituted burglary, none of the "
1552,"Federal burglary statutes, which are aimed at protecting Federal "
1553,34
1554,"property, banks, and interstate commerce, as opposed to private "
1555,"premises, seemed to be applicable. Another law, prohibiting con- "
1556,spiracy in the District of Columbia to commit an offense in another 
1557,"state, as defined by the other state’s law, required that the planned "
1558,action be an offense under both District of Columbia and the other 
1559,"state’s law, and the burglary and trespassing statutes of California "
1560,and the District of Columbia seemed too dissimilar to meet this 
1561,requirement. A charge of obstructing justice was also considered. 
1562,Such a charge would have been based on the theory that the break-in 
1563,was part of a plan to impair Ellsberg’s right to a fair trial by spreading 
1564,damaging information about him. Although one of the defendants 
1565,"later entered a guilty plea to this offense, WSPF decided not to rec- "
1566,ommend this charge to the grand jury for several reasons. In addition 
1567,"to difficulties of proof as to some defendants, an obstruction charge "
1568,might have put WSPF in the position of seeming to defend Ellsberg’s 
1569,"conduct in the course of the defendant’s trial, a position which the "
1570,prosecutors felt would unnecessarily complicate their task and raise 
1571,irrelevant issues. Another problem with an obstruction charge based 
1572,on the known facts was the possible future consequence of inhibiting 
1573,public officials from m&king statements on matters of public impor- 
1574,tance when such matters were also related to judicial proceedings. The 
1575,prosecutors also considered a charge of conspiring to defraud the 
1576,Government on the theory that the defendants had misapplied 
1577,Government funds and facilities in the anti-Ellsberg effort of which 
1578,"the break-in was a part. But this theory was rejected, as it would have "
1579,required proof of actions other than the break-in and would have 
1580,constituted an application of the conspiracy statute in an unusual 
1581,way that might have been confusing. 
1582,All these options involved legal or evidentiary difficulties that the 
1583,"prosecutors saw no reason to face, given the availability of a charge "
1584,which seemed clearly applicable — conspiring to violate Dr. Fielding’s 
1585,Fourth Amendment constitutional right to be free from unauthorized 
1586,governmental intrusion on his premises. Proof of this charge required 
1587,"only a showing that the defendants had authorized, planned, and con- "
1588,"ducted the break-in, and that they had thereby intended and agreed "
1589,to engage in conduct whose effect was to deprive Dr. Fislding of rights 
1590,clearly protected by the Fourth Amendment. The choice of this 
1591,charge involved considerable research on the requirements of the 
1592,statute (18 U.S.C. § 241) in proving each defendant’s intent to violate 
1593,"the Fourth Amendment, which the prosecutors decided could be met "
1594,by the evidence they would present to the jury. 
1595,Another choice the prosecutors often faced in deciding what indict- 
1596,ments to seek was whether to ask the grand jury to bring perjury 
1597,charges against people who appeared to have testified falsely before the 
1598,"grand jury or other bodies, such as Congressional committees. Al- "
1599,"though such deception had occurred often, many of the possible "
1600,35
1601,charges could not be brought because recent judicial interpretations 
1602,of the perjury statutes have held that an evasive or misleading state- 
1603,"ment, even if made with the obvious intent to deceive the questioner, "
1604,"does not constitute perjury if it is literally true. In Bronston v. U.S., "
1605,"the leading Supreme Court decision on this point, the questions and "
1606,answers were as follows: 
1607,Q: Do you have any bank accounts in the Swiss bank . . . ? 
1608,"A: No, sir. "
1609,Q: Have you ever? 
1610,"A: The company had an account there for about 6 months, in "
1611,Zurich. 
1612,"In fact, there was evidence that the witness previously had a Swiss "
1613,"bank account of his own, and his non-responsive answer to the second "
1614,question was apparently meant to conceal this fact. But the court 
1615,held that the answer did not constitute perjury since it was literally 
1616,"true; to commit perjury, the witness would have had to give a respon- "
1617,sive answer which was willfully false. 
1618,"Because of the exacting demands of a perjury prosecution, even "
1619,when the prosecutors were sure a witness had intentionally misled 
1620,"them in testifying before the grand jury, they had to search for a "
1621,sequence of specific questions and answers that met the crime's 
1622,narrow definition in order to bring a legally sustainable charge. Many 
1623,of the questions and answers constituting the basis of possible perjury 
1624,charges contained qualifying phrases and ambiguities which made it 
1625,difficult to show that this definition had been met. While the prose- 
1626,"cutors, when questioning witnesses before the grand jury, were aware "
1627,of the requirements of such a charge and tried to frame precise ques- 
1628,tions and insist on responsive answers when they suspected a witness 
1629,"was trying to deceive them, the main purpose of the questioning was to "
1630,"obtain information, not to create perjury cases. In addition, the "
1631,prosecutors often did not know enough facts at the time they ques- 
1632,tioned such witnesses to recognize that their testimony was mis- 
1633,leading. The same problems applied to possibly perjured testimony in 
1634,"other forums, such as the Senate Select Committee. "
1635,"After deciding what charge or charges would be appropriate, the "
1636,"prosecutors prepared the charging document, either an indictment to "
1637,be voted on by the grand jury or an information to be filed in court 
1638,by the Special Prosecutor. An information can be used instead of an 
1639,"indictment when only misdemeanors are charged, or, in felon}^ cases, "
1640,only if the defendant waives his right to have the matter presented to 
1641,"a grand jury. In accordance with common practice, WSPF used "
1642,informations instead of indictments in felony cases when discussions 
1643,with defense counsel had resulted in a defendant's decision to plead 
1644,36
1645,guilty to an agreed-upon charge at the time the information was 
1646,"filed in court. Having made such an agreement, the defendant no "
1647,longer needed the protection afforded by grand jury review of the 
1648,evidence. When such a plea agreement was made after evidence 
1649,"regarding a defendant had been presented to a grand jury, the "
1650,prosecutors usually explained to the grand jurors what the terms 
1651,of the agreement were and why it had been made. 
1652,"In felony cases, after hearing the evidence and the advice of "
1653,"prosecutors on the applicable law, grand juries deliberate and vote on "
1654,the proposed indictments the prosecutors have presented to them. 
1655,The law requires that at least 12 of the 23 grand jurors vote to return 
1656,"an indictment, and the grand jurors who heard evidence from WSPF "
1657,"were instructed by the court, like members of other grand juries in "
1658,"the District of Columbia, to concur in an indictment only if convinced "
1659,by the evidence that the defendant was guilty of the crime or crimes 
1660,"charged — that is, that the evidence, uncontradicted and unexplained, "
1661,would warrant a conviction by a trial jury. 
1662,Thus the indictment constitutes the grand jury’s finding that the 
1663,"evidence is sufficient to justify bringing a named person or persons, or "
1664,"an organization, to trial on one or more specific criminal charges. "
1665,The standard of proof required for a grand jury to vote an indictment 
1666,is lower than the absence of reasonable doubt needed for a trial jury 
1667,"to convict a defendant, because an indictment is only a formal pre-trial "
1668,"charge, while a conviction after trial subjects him to criminal penalties. "
1669,"Moreover, a grand jury indictment requires the concurrence of only "
1670,"a majority of the grand jurors, while a conviction requires the unani- "
1671,"mous vote of a trial jury. Despite these different standards of proof, "
1672,"WSPF, like many Federal prosecuting offices, attempted to approach "
1673,a standard of seeking indictments only when all the available 
1674,"evidence, including a defendant’s explanations, seemed likely to "
1675,produce a guilty verdict at trial. 
1676,One reason for making charging decisions on the basis of an evi- 
1677,dentiary standard higher than that required by law is to avoid sub- 
1678,"jecting anyone to the publicity, expense, and inconvenience of de- "
1679,fending himself against a charge that the prosecutors do not believe 
1680,will probably be sustained. Additional reasons for WSPF’s adopting 
1681,this higher standard were a desire to maintain its credibility with 
1682,witnesses and subjects of investigation and the confidence of the 
1683,"public, and to insure that the office exercised restraint and avoided "
1684,any possible abuses of its power. 
1685,"Thus, prosecutors’ decisions to charge involve consideration of "
1686,more than the sufficiency of the evidence as they and the grand 
1687,jurors view it. In assessing the likelihood that the evidence will 
1688,convince a jury of the defendant’s guilt when presented under the 
1689,37
1690,"conditions of a trial, prosecutors recognize that their familiarity with "
1691,all the facts of a case and their assessment of the credibility of wit- 
1692,"nesses cannot necessarily be transferred to a trial jury, where evidence "
1693,is strictly limited by trial rules and cross-examination can leave 
1694,"unpredictable impressions. Accordingly, WSPF’s attorneys tried to "
1695,anticipate the problems of a trial setting and the influence of that 
1696,setting on a juror’s perception of each case’s strength. 
1697,"The problem of witness credibility, for example, is affected by "
1698,jurors’ perceptions of what kind of “deal” the witness obtained from 
1699,the Government. Defense attorneys often characterized such a plea 
1700,"bargain as a reward for testimony favorable to the prosecution, rather "
1701,than the witness’ admission of guilt and agreement to testify truth- 
1702,"fully. As noted above, this was a major reason why WSPF was reluc- "
1703,"tant to seek immunity for any important witness and tried to insist, "
1704,"when plea bargaining with any such witness, on a guilty plea which "
1705,jurors would perceive as an admission of guilt for conduct related to 
1706,the charge against the defendant in whose trial the witness would 
1707,be testifying. 
1708,A related problem arises in most “white-collar” and organized 
1709,crime conspiracy cases. Those who eventually become Government 
1710,"witnesses often have committed perjury, have made false or misleading "
1711,"public statements earlier in the investigation, or have been convicted "
1712,of crimes in the past. Defense strategy necessarily focuses on such 
1713,"facts as weaknesses in the Government’s case. Thus, in contrast "
1714,"to a robbery case, for example, in which the jury must decide between "
1715,the complainant’s testimony and the defendant’s version (if he 
1716,"testifies), “white collar” prosecutions normally require two or more "
1717,"witnesses for the Government, or one principal witness whose testi- "
1718,mony is corroborated by circumstantial evidence or by documents. 
1719,"In some cases, where the principal witness’ version contrasts sharply "
1720,"with the defendant’s narrative, documentary evidence also may be "
1721,sought to show that the defendant’s version is false. In a few of 
1722,"WSPF’s cases, problems of witness credibility, combined with lack "
1723,"of documentary affirmation, led to decisions not to prosecute. In others, "
1724,they affected the choice of possible charges against a defendant. 
1725,Another tactical consideration involved the use of the Federal 
1726,conspiracy statute (18 U.S.C. § 371) in cases involving agreements 
1727,among people to violate Federal law and their actions taken pursuant 
1728,to such agreements. Conspirators are normally tried together in the 
1729,"same proceeding, and, once the Government has demonstrated by "
1730,prima facie evidence that a conspiracy existed and that certain persons 
1731,"had joined, the acts and statements of each such conspirator in further- "
1732,ance of the conspiracy’s goals constitute evidence against any member 
1733,"of the conspiracy. Thus, when the evidence indicated that a conspiracy "
1734,38
1735,"had existed and had resulted in provable actions, the prosecutors "
1736,brought appropriate conspiracy charges . 1 
1737,Once the prosecutors had decided that their prospective case 
1738,"against a defendant was strong enough in factual, legal, and tactical "
1739,"terms to justify charging him, other factors sometimes came into play. "
1740,"Historically, prosecutors have had broad discretion in deciding "
1741,"whether to file charges in criminal cases, and have taken into account "
1742,factors other than those the law requires them to consider. The 
1743,American Bar Association has noted some of these in its Standards 
1744,"Relating to the Prosecution Function , which provide in part: "
1745,The prosecutor is not obliged to present all charges which the 
1746,evidence might support. The prosecutor may in some circum- 
1747,stances and for good cause consistent with the public interest 
1748,"decline to prosecute, notwithstanding that evidence may exist "
1749,which would support a conviction. Illustrative of the factors which 
1750,prosecutors may properly consider in exercising this descretion 
1751,are: 
1752,(ii) the extent of the harm caused by the offense ; 
1753,(iii) the disproportion of the authorized punishment in relation 
1754,to the particular offense of the offender; 
1755,(iv) cooperation of the accused in the apprehension or convic- 
1756,tion of others. 
1757,"For the most part, and for reasons similar to those which dictated "
1758,"a conservative approach to immunity, these discretionary factors were "
1759,important only in reducing charges as part of an agreement whereby 
1760,"a defendant would enter a guilty plea. In a few cases, however, con- "
1761,siderations such as a defendant’s health resulted in decisions not to 
1762,"prosecute at all. In a few campaign contribution cases, in addition to "
1763,"individual factors present in all cases, potential defendants had relied "
1764,on the advice of counsel or on prior explicit non-enforcement decisions 
1765,by Government agencies in concluding that their activities had been 
1766,"lawful, and the prosecutors decided not to charge them because their "
1767,"1 Over the years, many lawyers and commentators have criticized the Federal "
1768,conspiracy laws and the rules of evidence involved in their use at trial. Most of 
1769,the criticism focuses on use of the conspiracy concept in factual situations where 
1770,a purported agreement was not followed by enough action to warrant such a 
1771,"strong criminal sanction, or where the so-called agreement was based on facts "
1772,showing persons performing the same kinds of acts with little or no indication 
1773,that an agreement or plan among them had produced the similar actions. In the 
1774,"conspiracy cases brought by WSPF, this potential for abuse was not present: in "
1775,"each case, the prosecutors believed they could show that the defendants had made "
1776,an agreement and then had taken actions pursuant to the agreement. In some 
1777,investigations that showed an apparent agreement or a strong inclination to com- 
1778,"mit acts that probably would have been criminal if carried out, the prosecutors "
1779,decided not to bring charges because there was little or no evidence that the plan 
1780,had actually been implemented. 
1781,39
1782,violations seemed to rest upon honest misunderstandings of the law. 
1783,"In addition, when a possible defendant had already been convicted "
1784,of a serious crime as a result of WSPF’s work and given a sentence of 
1785,"imprisonment, it seemed undesirable and unnecessary to bring addi- "
1786,"tional charges against him, particularly since any additional sentence "
1787,he might receive would probably run concurrently with the sentences 
1788,"already imposed, having no effect on the actual period of "
1789,imprisonment. 
1790,The final charging decisions were always made by the Special 
1791,Prosecutor . 2 The process of reaching these decisions resembled the 
1792,practice of the Justice Department’s Cirminal Division in major 
1793,"cases, involving more formal preparation and discussion than usually "
1794,"takes place in most U.S. Attorney’s offices. Typically, the lawyers "
1795,who had handled the investigation prepared a prosecution memoran- 
1796,"dum setting forth the facts of the case, the applicable law, the evidence "
1797,"available for use at trial, any foreseeable defenses or weaknesses in "
1798,"the case, and their recommendations; a draft indictment often ac- "
1799,companied this memorandum. Discussions with the head of the 
1800,"task force, and perhaps with other lawyers within it, produced a "
1801,"recommendation, or in some cases conflicting recommendations, "
1802,"to the Special Prosecutor, which his Deputy, his Counsel, and some- "
1803,times other attorneys in the office then reviewed. 
1804,A WSPF departure from many Federal prosecutors’ normal 
1805,practice was to invite the prospective defendant’s lawyer to present 
1806,any arguments he might have against prosecution; in almost all cases 
1807,the lawyers accepted such invitations. This was done to make sure 
1808,that the Special Prosecutor’s final decision took into account any pos- 
1809,sible weaknesses in the case or defenses that might be raised after 
1810,"the charges had been made public. On a few occasions, defense lawyers "
1811,succeeded in convincing the prosecutors that their clients would 
1812,"probably be acquitted if they were charged, or that charges were "
1813,"likely to be dismissed, thus preventing prosecutions of dubious merit. "
1814,The Special Prosecutor’s final decision often came after extensive 
1815,"discussions within the office, and in a few cases, serious disagreements. "
1816,By the time the prosecutors were ready to make a charging deci- 
1817,"sion in any case, they had usually had enough contact with defense "
1818,counsel to know whether the case was likely to go to trial or whether 
1819,the defendant could be expected to plead guilty in return for a reduc- 
1820,tion in his total liability. In the minority of cases where a plea bargain 
1821,2 Each of the three Special Prosecutors recused himself as to certain matters 
1822,"which involved actual or possible conflicts of interest, delegating all decision- "
1823,"making to his deputy or another member of the senior staff. For example, Special "
1824,Prosecutor Jaworski took no part in decisions on matters relating to the dairy 
1825,industry's activities because his law firm had been involved in litigation to which 
1826,the principal dairy cooperative had been a party and because he was personally 
1827,acquainted with some of the persons involved in the investigation. 
1828,40
1829,"was never expected or could not be agreed on by the parties, the "
1830,prosecutors began to prepare for trial after filing the charges. Trial 
1831,preparation involved the steps usually taken by prosecutors — deciding 
1832,"which witnesses to call and in what order, deciding which of the attor- "
1833,"neys would perform what functions during the trial, preparing and "
1834,"arguing pretrial briefs and motions, preparing the opening statement "
1835,and other such actions. 
1836,"In several cases, WSPF was faced with a pretrial problem which "
1837,prosecutors do not normally find difficult to resolve: meeting the 
1838,legal requirement of providing defendants with information claimed 
1839,to be necessary for their defense . 3 Apart from the efforts required to 
1840,locate all such material available to them and supply copies to defend- 
1841,"ants, the prosecutors also faced defense contentions that they were "
1842,entitled to material held by Congressional committees and the White 
1843,House. These materials might be unavailable to WSPF — in the case 
1844,of the committees because they are part of a separate branch of 
1845,"Government, in the case of the White House because of its adversary "
1846,relationship with WSPF during the Nixon Administration. 
1847,"Fortunately, most Congressional committees agreed to supply "
1848,WSPF for this purpose with relevant material they held. In the one 
1849,"case where such materials were not supplied, the trial judge ruled "
1850,that the disclosure requirement did not apply to the legislative branch. 
1851,No defendant was able to show that the White House withheld 
1852,exculpatory evidence. 
1853,PLEA BARGAINING 
1854,"In the majority of cases, pretrial problems did not arise because "
1855,the prosecutors had reasons to expect pleas of guilty through agree- 
1856,ments negotiated with defendants and their lawyers. Plea bargaining 
1857,"accounted for the disposition of most of the cases brought by WSPF, "
1858,as it does for the great majority of criminal cases throughout the 
1859,country. 
1860,Although the prosecutors never brought a charge they did not 
1861,"believe they could support at trial, they were usually willing to "
1862,reduce a defendant’s total liability in return for his guilty plea to 
1863,3 Federal prosecutors are obliged to provide defendants with so-called “Jencks” 
1864,material — copies of certain relevant prior written or transcribed statements and 
1865,all such statements of government trial witnesses which are available to the 
1866,"Government, and WSPF was required in some cases to supply these before trial. "
1867,Prosecutors are also required to supply defendants with “Brady” material — any 
1868,evidence they have which might show that a defendant was not guilty. Although 
1869,the office’s legal position has been that such material must be supplied only when 
1870,"it is under the control of a non-adversary part of the executive branch, the prose- "
1871,cutors endeavored to go beyond the law’s requirements in assuring that defendants 
1872,received all relevant material. 
1873,41
1874,an appropriate charge and cooperation in their investigations. If 
1875,"they had not been willing to do so, many of the investigations would "
1876,"not have progressed nearly as far as they did, and would have un- "
1877,"covered far less evidence of criminal activity by fewer people. Often, "
1878,"because of the nature of the matters being investigated, the only "
1879,hope of developing provable cases lay in obtaining the cooperation 
1880,of witnesses who had been involved in the same activities. In many 
1881,investigations the office initially developed evidence of one person’s 
1882,"criminal liability, disposed of his case through plea bargaining in "
1883,"return for his cooperation, and obtained from him additional evidence "
1884,which led to the prosecution of others. To achieve this result in a 
1885,"reasonable amount of time, the only alternative to plea bargaining "
1886,with a suspect was not bringing him to trial but granting him 
1887,immunity. 
1888,Plea bargaining speeded up not only the investigative process 
1889,but also the process of public exposure of wrongdoing. A guilty plea 
1890,by a defendant in a major case involved his public admission of 
1891,conduct constituting one or more crimes and his agreement to tell 
1892,the prosecutors what he knew about the criminal activities in which 
1893,he had taken part and about the involvement of others. Thus it 
1894,advanced the public’s understanding of the extent of wrongdoing 
1895,"in high places, weakened the often-heard assertions, particularly "
1896,"in the Watergate case, that criminal conduct had been confined to "
1897,"a handful of lower-echelon employees, and put other potential wit- "
1898,nesses and defendants on notice that their knowledge about or 
1899,"involvement in crimes might soon be disclosed to WSPF, thereby "
1900,increasing their incentive to cooperate with the office. 
1901,"By its nature, plea bargaining results in a less complete public "
1902,exposure of the evidence and the facts of a defendant’s conduct 
1903,than a trial would provide. But a criminal trial also has limited 
1904,value in bringing the facts of wrongdoing to public attention. The 
1905,evidence presented in a trial is usually only a part of the information 
1906,gathered in an investigation. The defendant’s right not to testify 
1907,can prevent the disclosure of many facts about his conduct. Many 
1908,kinds of misconduct discovered in investigations are not crimes and 
1909,therefore cannot be the subject of charges or trials. Because the 
1910,prosecutors are required to prove every charge beyond a reasonable 
1911,"doubt, they limit their proof to the facts which they can show most "
1912,"clearly and convincingly at trial, omitting other facts which might "
1913,be highly informative to the public but have little value as evidence 
1914,"in a trial setting. Perhaps most important, a trial of a single person "
1915,or even several defendants can at best reveal only the evidence 
1916,"related to their alleged criminal acts, without presenting fully all "
1917,available evidence of other peoples’ involvement in the same course 
1918,"of conduct. In short, while a trial is usually an effective way to assess "
1919,"a defendant’s criminal responsibility in a fair manner, it is not espeei- "
1920,42
1921,ally effective in informing the public fully about his or anyone else's 
1922,"conduct, nor is it meant to serve such a purpose. "
1923,Plea bargaining tends under some conditions to produce unfair 
1924,results — innocent people pleading guilty to avoid the uncertainty 
1925,"and delay of a trial, people who could be convicted of very serious "
1926,crimes pleading guilty to much less serious offenses and receiving 
1927,minimal sentences. Such distortions sometimes occur in overloaded 
1928,"urban court systems, where backlogs of pending cases force prosecutors "
1929,to make major concessions and the pressures of pretrial detention and 
1930,overburdened public defenders lead some defendants to plead guilty 
1931,although they would not be convicted at a trial. But such assembly- 
1932,line conditions did not apply to the cases WSPF handled. Certainly 
1933,there were no such pressures on defendants to plead guilty in WSPF's 
1934,cases. They were not jailed before trial unless they were serving 
1935,"sentences for other offenses, and all were represented by private "
1936,attorneys who could give adequate attention to their cases. 
1937,"However, there were substantial pressures on WSPF to plea "
1938,bargain. While the office had no backlogs of the sort that big-city 
1939,"prosecutors commonly face, requiring them to dispose of large numbers "
1940,"of cases on a daily basis, the campaign contributions task force in "
1941,particular had a heavy workload of matters to investigate and 
1942,"prosecute, and was generally more reluctant than the other task forces "
1943,to devote the time and personnel that long and complex trials would 
1944,"have required. Furthermore, the conduct involved in election-law "
1945,reporting violations was seen as less serious than that often found in 
1946,"other areas of the office's investigations, such as obstruction of justice "
1947,and perjury. Some of the election laws whose violations the taskforce 
1948,"uncovered have been unenforced for many years, in some cases because "
1949,of announced Justice Department non-enforcement policies. While the 
1950,task force knew that one of its important functions was to reverse 
1951,such policies and establish precedents for enforcing the campaign 
1952,"laws, it did not seem fair to initiate such a policy change by imposing "
1953,on individual defendants the full burden of serious criminal liability. 
1954,"Particularly in the area of campaign laws, evidence sufficient to "
1955,lead to convictions often would not have been obtained without plea 
1956,bargaining. Such investigations would require examining each 
1957,corporation's records in search of large cash diversions that might 
1958,indicate concealed contributions that had remained undiscovered in 
1959,years of continuous tax audits. The next step would be the difficult 
1960,if not impossible task of getting testimony from someone within the 
1961,corporation about the disposition of the cash. This process would 
1962,"clearly take a great deal of time and effort, and the chances of its "
1963,leading to criminal charges and convictions in the foreseeable future 
1964,were uncertain at best. 
1965,These considerations led Special Prosecutor Cox to announce in 
1966,October 1973 a plea-bargaining policy aimed at encouraging corpora- 
1967,43
1968,tions to volunteer the facts of any illegal campaign contributions in 
1969,the 1972 elections. The early public disclosure by American Airlines 
1970,that it had made an illegal contribution prompted Cox to issue such 
1971,"an invitation to all corporations, promising that their voluntary dis- "
1972,closures would be considered in disposing of their cases. 
1973,"In October, after some other corporations had made such dis- "
1974,"closures, Cox announced that while such “volunteer” corporations "
1975,would be charged with making illegal contributions of corporate funds 
1976,"(18 U.S.C. § 610), only the primarily responsible officer of each such "
1977,"corporation would be charged, and that charge would be a one- count "
1978,misdemeanor violation of § 610. This policy resulted in guilty pleas 
1979,by 12 corporations and 10 corporate officers — the first group of con- 
1980,victions of corporate officers for consenting to illegal contributions in 
1981,many years. 
1982,The announcement of a policy aimed at inducing corporations 
1983,and their principal officers to make voluntary disclosure was coupled 
1984,with a warning that efforts by corporate officials to obstruct investi- 
1985,gations would be considered as aggravating factors in WSPF’s charging 
1986,"and plea-bargaining decisions. In two cases, such obstructive conduct "
1987,resulted in the felony convictions of two executives for violating con- 
1988,tribution laws. And the “volunteer” corporations were required to 
1989,disclose the slush funds and bookkeeping methods they had used to 
1990,"conceal their illegal contributions, thereby incurring possible liability "
1991,"under the tax laws, the Securities and Exchange Act, and other regu- "
1992,latory statutes. 
1993,"The nature of some other matters WSPF was investigating, and the "
1994,"circumstances under which the prosecutors worked, also led to plea "
1995,"bargaining. In the midst of a national crisis, WSPF felt an obligation "
1996,to complete its investigations and establish individuals’ criminal re- 
1997,"sponsibility, or lack of responsibility, as quickly as was consistent "
1998,with thoroughness and fairness. Plea bargaining provided a means of 
1999,doing so. It also provided both prosecutors and defendants with a 
2000,chance to avoid the delays and uncertainties involved in trials. When 
2001,"he approved agreements with defendants and their lawyers, the "
2002,Special Prosecutor was making largely subjective judgments that such 
2003,benefits were worth the price in terms of defendant’s reduced liability. 
2004,Whether those judgments were correct is a question on which people 
2005,"m&y reasonably differ from case to case. On some of them, there was "
2006,"serious disagreement within the office, resulting on one occasion in the "
2007,resignations of staff members. 
2008,The perceived benefits of plea settlements were accompanied by 
2009,prosecutors’ concerns that the resulting agreements reflected appro- 
2010,priately the nature and seriousness of such defendants’ conduct. This 
2011,concern required the Special Prosecutor to determine whether a pro- 
2012,"posed disposition was adequate in two respects. First, he had to de- "
2013,termine whether the admitted guilt included a sufficiently serious 
2014,44
2015,"charge to allow the judge adequate scope for sentencing. Second, he "
2016,had to decide whether the plea would resolve the issue of the defendant’s 
2017,guilt or innocence of the underlying conduct which the evidence 
2018,established. 
2019,"Tn resolving the first question, the Special Prosecutor was generally "
2020,"prepared to accept a guilty plea to a one-count felony charge, most of "
2021,"which carry a 5-year maximum sentence under Federal law, in any "
2022,case in which the defendant’s potential liability was greater. As to 
2023,"the second question, the general practice was to attempt to require a "
2024,disposition which made clear that the defendant was guilty of at least 
2025,one of the principal charges that could be brought against him. Be- 
2026,"cause of this desire to resolve issues of guilt, the office refused to accept "
2027,pleas permitted by the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. 
2028,"Alford, in which the defendant asserts his innocence at the time of "
2029,the plea 4 but makes an informed judgment that a guilty plea is more 
2030,"advantageous to him than risking a trial. For similar reasons, with the "
2031,exception of one case in which an individual defendant’s earlier ad- 
2032,missions of campaign-law violations was seen as especially helpful in 
2033,"encouraging others to come forward, no defendant was permitted to "
2034,"plead nolo contendere. Such a plea does not acknowledge guilt, although "
2035,its legal effect is much the same as that of a guilty plea. 
2036,In some cases the Special Prosecutor 'was willing to accept pleas 
2037,to crimes which were less serious than felonies carrying 5-year sen- 
2038,"tences, or which failed to fully resolve the defendant’s guilt or in- "
2039,"nocence of the charges against him. 5 As noted above, it is difficult to "
2040,define precisely the bases of discretionary decisions to charge and to 
2041,"plea bargain. However, among the considerations which led to the "
2042,acceptance of such pleas were the fact that the offense most ac- 
2043,curately defining the defendant’s conduct carried less than a 5-year 
2044,"maximum penalty, the nature and seriousness of the defendant’s "
2045,"criminal conduct, the belief that unique or unusual facts and cir- "
2046,"cumstances explained or mitigated the seriousness of the conduct, "
2047,"evaluation of the strength of the case if it should go to trial, the im- "
2048,portance to the prosecutors of the defendant’s cooperation and the 
2049,"nature of such cooperation, and the existence of any representations "
2050,made to the defendant in the course of his dealings with the office. 
2051,4 Because the prosecutors did not think it proper to insist that a defendant 
2052,acknowledge greater degrees of moral guilt or criminal intent than the plea re- 
2053,"quired, simply because he was admitting legal liability, and because the pro- "
2054,secutors did not believe they should become involved in any statement a defendant 
2055,"might make outside of court, some defendants after entering guilty pleas made "
2056,out-of-court statements to the effect that they were innocent of wrongdoing. 
2057,5 The “volunteer” policy in corporate-contribution cases involved a blanket 
2058,exception to the general practice. In most cases the evidence w r ould have supported 
2059,"a felony charge against the responsible officer, but because of his cooperation and "
2060,"other factors discussed previously, he was charged with a “non- willful” mis- "
2061,demeanor violation. 
2062,45
2063,"There was, of course, an inevitable tension between the prosecutors' "
2064,goal that pleas of guilty be to appropriately serious charges and the 
2065,defendant's incentive to obtain a reduction in his potential liability. 
2066,WSPF used several possible approaches in dealing with this tension. 
2067,"In some cases, when a defendant's potential liability included charges "
2068,"of multiple but related violations of the same statute, the prosecutors "
2069,dropped most of the charges in exchange for a guilty plea to one or 
2070,"a few of them, usually those supported by the strongest evidence of "
2071,the defendant's overall criminal activities. Another approach was to 
2072,drop charges of perjury or making false statements in exchange for 
2073,a guilty plea to the crime or crimes whose concealment had been the 
2074,purpose of the false statements. A third method was to drop substan- 
2075,tive charges in exchange for a guilty plea to a conspiracy charge whose 
2076,proof would include evidence of the conduct violating one or more 
2077,of the substantive criminal statutes. 6 
2078,Other patterns were also followed. The selection of charges to 
2079,be used for guilty plea purposes depended heavily on the facts and 
2080,circumstances of each case. If a defendant was facing charges or pos- 
2081,sible charges in another jurisdiction or in connection with the investi- 
2082,"gations of more than one of WSPF's task forces, it was necessary to "
2083,take his liability as to all such matters into account in plea bargaining. 
2084,This could result in a defendant's pleading guilty to charges in one 
2085,area of WSPF's investigations in return for the dismissal of charges 
2086,in another task force's area or in another jurisdiction which were 
2087,unrelated except in the sense that the same defendant was involved. 
2088,"When charges outside WSPF's jurisdiction affected plea bargaining, "
2089,the prosecutors consulted with the Assistant Attorney General in 
2090,charge of the Justice Department's Criminal Division and obtained 
2091,his consent to the disposition. 
2092,In assessing the effect of a particular plea bargain on a defendant's 
2093,"liability, prosecutors and defense attorneys generally compare the "
2094,sentence he realistically seems likely to receive if convicted on all 
2095,possible charges against the sentence he seems likely to receive after 
2096,his plea. WSPF also used this means to assess what benefit a partic- 
2097,"ular plea bargain would provide a defendant. For example, an elderly "
2098,defendant with a very ill wife would probably not receive consecutive 
2099,"sentences on multiple charges, particularly if he had had a previously "
2100,distinguished career without prior criminal involvement. A possible 
2101,2 to 5-year maximum sentence on one felony plea did not represent 
2102,a significant concession by a prosecutor who could bring other possible 
2103,"criminal charges against that defendant arising out of similar activities, "
2104,"8 When plea agreements had been reached before the filing of formal charges, "
2105,the prosecutors filed only the charges to which the defendant intended to plead 
2106,"guilty. When charges had already been filed before the agreement, the prosecutors "
2107,consented to the dismissal on the defendant’s motion of charges to which he was 
2108,not pleading guilty. 
2109,4$ 
2110,Two of the factors listed as proper by the ABA Standards for 
2111,prosecutorial consideration in charging are “the extent of harm caused 
2112,the offense” and “the disproportion of the authorized punishment 
2113,in relation to the particular offense or the offender.” These considera- 
2114,tions imply a concern for proportional equity among defendants which 
2115,often weighed in WSPF's plea bargaining practices. When a person 
2116,who had played an important and responsible role in the course of 
2117,criminal conduct had received the benefit of a plea bargain because 
2118,"of his ability to supply the prosecutors with information they needed, "
2119,or could not be charged with the most serious of his probable offenses 
2120,"because of evidential or legal difficulties, the prosecutors were reluc- "
2121,"tant to insist that someone else, who had played a relatively minor "
2122,"role in the same activities, plead guilty to a more serious charge. "
2123,While WSPF took the view that a defendant who had played a sub- 
2124,ordinate role in major criminal conduct or had occupied a lower-level 
2125,"position in a Government organization should, if possible, be charged, "
2126,"concern for proportionality suggested that a subordinate should not, "
2127,"if possible, face greater liability than the person who had directed his "
2128,"criminal activities or otherwise bore greater responsibility. Thus, "
2129,"when relatively minor figures had been convicted of serious offenses, "
2130,the prosecutors believed that those with greater responsibility or 
2131,those who had committed more serious crimes should plead to factual 
2132,"charges that show the difference in their culpability, and WSPF "
2133,supplied the evidence of their more serious conduct to the probation 
2134,officer who would recommend a sentence to the judge. 
2135,Since in most cases a major purpose of plea bargaining was to 
2136,"obtain the defendant's cooperation in WSPF's investigations, it was "
2137,necessary for the prosecutors to know in broad terms what information 
2138,he could provide and to have some confidence that he would be co- 
2139,operative and truthful. In some of the cases where a prospective 
2140,defendant had not been cooperating with WSPF before plea bar- 
2141,"gaining, his counsel offered a hypothetical statement of the significant "
2142,evidence he would provide. The prosecutors then decided whether 
2143,"they believed his expected cooperation, combined with other factors, "
2144,"justified a plea bargain, and, if so, made an appropriate offer to the "
2145,"defense attorney. Sometimes this process required several meetings, "
2146,during which defendants' attorneys brought to the prosecutors' atten- 
2147,tion exculpatory facts about their clients or points of law in their 
2148,favor. The prosecutors then had to meet among themselves to decide 
2149,whether to agree to any defense proposal or accept any argument for 
2150,"reduced liability, and the defense lawyers had to"" relay prosecution "
2151,"offers back to their clients, advise them about the wisdom of accepting "
2152,"or rejecting the offer, and return to the prosecutors with their responses "
2153,or counter-proposals. Many of the completed plea agreements involved 
2154,very close decisions within WSPF and strong disagreements among 
2155,the prosecutors. 
2156,47
2157,"Except in the cases of “volunteer” corporate contributors, where "
2158,a plea-bargaining policy had been announced publicly before the 
2159,"disposition of any case, the terms of each agreement were embodied "
2160,"in a letter from the Special Prosecutor to the defense attorney, which "
2161,was made public and filed in court at the time the plea was entered. 
2162,Ordinarily this letter indicated that the defendant would plead 
2163,"guilty to a specified charge or charges; usually, the plea would cover "
2164,"his criminal liability in matters then known to WSPF, but in some "
2165,cases pleas covered liability only in connection with more limited 
2166,matters specified in the letter. The agreement did not cover any 
2167,"future criminal conduct, including perjury, or any undisclosed past "
2168,crimes which WSPF might uncover in the future and was conditioned 
2169,on the defendant’s giving truthful statements or testimony. In most 
2170,"cases, the defendant would agree to cooperate fully with WSPF by "
2171,revealing his knowledge of all matters under investigation and 
2172,testifying if necessary at the trials of others. 
2173,"It was further agreed that the extent of his cooperation, as the "
2174,"prosecutors perceived it, would be made known to the court at the "
2175,time of sentencing. 
2176,The greatest concern of most plea-bargaining defendants was the 
2177,"sentence they were likely to get, particularly their chances of being "
2178,imprisoned for any period of time. The prosecutors’ position on sen- 
2179,"tencing, like that of most federal prosecutors, was to insist that the "
2180,defendant plead guilty to a charge whose authorized maximum 
2181,penalty would allow a judge to impose an adequate term of imprison- 
2182,ment if he felt one was warranted. The prosecutors also reserved 
2183,"the right to submit to the probation officer of the court, for the "
2184,"pre-sentence report, a statement of the evidence they had gathered "
2185,which tended to show the full circumstances of the conduct the 
2186,"defendant had acknowledged in his plea, and similar conduct in "
2187,which he had engaged; a copy of this statement was given to defense 
2188,counsel but it was not subject to his approval. While the prosecutors 
2189,"did not recommend sentences, they reserved the right to challenge "
2190,any false or misleading factual statements made by the defendant 
2191,or his counsel at the time of sentencing . 7 
2192,Defendants who were lawyers were often most concerned about a 
2193,"conviction’s effect on their licenses to practice law. In their cases, the "
2194,"prosecutors supplied copies of the indictment or information, the letter "
2195,"describing the plea bargain, and all other papers submitted in court on "
2196,the case to the Center for Professional Discipline of the American Bar 
2197,"7 In one case, the prosecutors agreed to inform the judge that the defendant "
2198,would have been charged with a less serious offense if one could have been found 
2199,"which accurately described his conduct. In another, they agreed to call the "
2200,judge’s attention to the sentencing provisions of a substantive statute carrying 
2201,a less severe maximum penalty than the conspiracy charge to which the defendant 
2202,had entered his plea. 
2203,48
2204,Association and to the Special Committee on Watergate Discipline of 
2205,the National Organization of Bar Counsel. These organizations had 
2206,agreed to notify the relevant state bar associations of the convictions 
2207,"of any of their members, and to monitor any disciplinary proceedings "
2208,such state bodies undertook as a result. WSPF also responded to 
2209,requests from State and District of Columbia bar organizations for 
2210,information regarding the conduct of lawyers who had been convicted. 
2211,WSPF’s policy against making sentence recommendations applied 
2212,"to cases disposed of either by guilty plea or by trial verdict, and was "
2213,"based on the view, shared by many prosecutors, that sentencing is a "
2214,judicial function which judges can perform more effectively than 
2215,"prosecutors. However, it is important that sentencing judges be aware "
2216,"of all the facts relevant to their decision, and in plea bargaining the "
2217,"prosecutors reserved their right to inform the judge of such facts, as "
2218,"described above. After conviction by trial or plea, the sentencing of "
2219,many defendants was delayed long enough to permit probation officers 
2220,"to prepare a pre-sentence report for the judge’s use. However, in all "
2221,"the “volunteer” corporate contribution cases and a few others, at the "
2222,"initiative of the judge, defendants were sentenced immediately after "
2223,"the entry of their pleas, with neither pre-sentence reports from the "
2224,probation office nor factual information from the prosecutors beyond a 
2225,description of the offense which was the subject of the plea. 
2226,49
2227,Major Investigations and 
2228,Other Actions 
2229,The five task forces of WSPF conducted investigations of several 
2230,"hundred separate matters, and the counsel's office provided legal and "
2231,policy advice and other services to the task forces and the Special 
2232,Prosecutor. The most important work of the five task forces and the 
2233,counsel's office is described in summary form in this chapter. Not 
2234,included are large numbers of investigations each of which involved a 
2235,relatively minor commitment of office resources and did not result in 
2236,criminal charges. Also omitted are a number of investigations requir- 
2237,ing more substantial efforts which have not been publicly disclosed in 
2238,the past and which did not result in charges. Reporting them here 
2239,"would publicize, for the first time and in an improper forum, allega- "
2240,tions from which the prosecutors concluded they should not initiate 
2241,court action for the various reasons cited in Chapter 2. In the investiga- 
2242,"tions included within this chapter, allegations are cited if they have "
2243,already received extensive publicity or if they had become public 
2244,"through court proceedings, legislative inquiries or other forums. As to "
2245,"these also, when no prosecution resulted, the prosecutors made the "
2246,"decision on the basis of one of the factors, or a combination thereof, as "
2247,outlined in Chapter 2. 
2248,WATERGATE TASK FORCE 
2249,Investigation of Watergate Cover-Up 
2250,"When WSPF was established in May 1973, seven men already had "
2251,"been convicted of burglary, conspiracy, and wiretapping charges in "
2252,connection with the break-in at the Democratic National Committee 
2253,"headquarters on June 17, 1972. Part of the public testimony before "
2254,the Senate Select Committee supported allegations that high officials 
2255,of the Administration and the President's re-election campaign 
2256,either had sponsored the break-in or had tried to prevent the original 
2257,"investigation from reaching beyond those seven. In addition, the "
2258,"Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the D strict of Columbia, who had "
2259,"handled the investigation until the Special Prosecutor's appointment, "
2260,SO 
2261,had obtained information strongly suggesting the involvement of 
2262,others. 
2263,"By October 19, as a result of information developed by the U.S. "
2264,"Attorney’s office and then by WSPF, three important witnesses had "
2265,pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in connection with the cover- 
2266,up — former campaign officials Fred La Rue and Jeb Magruder and 
2267,former White House counsel John Dean. All three later testified for 
2268,the prosecution at the trial of others involved. WSPF also obtained a 
2269,"guilty plea from former campaign official Herbert Porter, to a charge "
2270,of making false statements to a Government agency in connection 
2271,with the cover-up. 
2272,Along with efforts in the summer and fall of 1973 to obtain the 
2273,"cooperation of these witnesses, WSPF also attempted to obtain by "
2274,grand jury subpoena other relevant evidence in the form of documents 
2275,and tape recordings of Presidential conversations. Special Prosecutor 
2276,Cox’s efforts to obtain compliance with the subpoena resulted in his 
2277,"dismissal at President Nixon’s direction in October, followed by the "
2278,appointment of Special Prosecutor Jaworski and the production of 
2279,some of the subpoenaed materials. The President’s compliance with 
2280,"the subpoena was incomplete, however (see below, the discussion of "
2281,"the 18 % minute gap), and the necessaiy inquiries into the causes of "
2282,his failure to so comply further delayed the development and presenta- 
2283,tion to the grand jury of evidence relating to the cover-up. 
2284,"Nevertheless, by March 1974, the grand jury had obtained "
2285,"sufficient evidence to hand up indictments on charges of conspiracy, "
2286,obstruction of justice and perjury; seven men formerly associated 
2287,with the White House or the President’s campaign committee were 
2288,"named as defendants to one or more of the charges — Charles Colson, "
2289,"John Ehrlichman, H. R. Haldeman, Robert Mardian, John Mitchell, "
2290,"Kenneth Parkinson, and Gordon Strachan. At the Special Prosecutor’s "
2291,"suggestion, the grand jury also submitted a report which the court "
2292,transmitted under seal to the House Judiciary Committee in connec- 
2293,tion with its inquiry into the possible impeachment of President 
2294,Nixon. The report contained evidence relevant to the Committee’s 
2295,inquiry into the President’s possible involvement in the cover-up. 
2296,"In addition, the grand jury authorized the Special Prosecutor to "
2297,"name 18 individuals, including President Nixon, as unindicted "
2298,co-conspirators. 
2299,"After the indictment, the Special Prosecutor obtained a trial "
2300,subpoena for additional White House tapes and documents. Much of 
2301,the summer of 1974 was consumed by litigation over the validity of 
2302,"this subpoena, which was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court, "
2303,and by examination of the materials produced in compliance with 
2304,"the court’s decision. During this period, the House Committee com- "
2305,pleted its impeachment inquiry by recommending the President’s 
2306,"impeachment, the President publicly released transcripts of several "
2307,51
2308,subpoenaed tapes which showed him to have been a parti- 
2309,"cipant in the cover-up, and he resigned his office August 9. The "
2310,prosecutors immediately began to review the question of his possible 
2311,"criminal liability, but before any final decision could be made on "
2312,whether to recommend his indictment he was pardoned by his 
2313,"successor, President Ford. "
2314,"By the time the trial started on October 1, charges against Colson "
2315,had been dismissed as a result of his guilty plea in another case (see 
2316,"below, the discussion of Fielding break-in), and those against Strachan "
2317,"had been severed. The trial of the five remaining defendants, which "
2318,"lasted 3 months, resulted in the convictions of Ehrlichman, Haldeman, "
2319,"Mardian, and Mitchell, and the acquittal of Parkinson. Mitchell, "
2320,Haldeman and Ehrlichman were each sentenced to serve 2% to 8 
2321,"years imprisonment, while Mardian received a 10-month to 3-year "
2322,prison sentence. All four convictions are now on appeal. The charges 
2323,against Strachan were dismissed on motion of the Special Prosecutor 
2324,because the legal effect of immunity granted to him by the Assistant 
2325,U.S. Attorneys and the Senate Committee created doubts about 
2326,whether he could be tried without infringing upon his constitutional 
2327,privilege against self-incrimination. 
2328,"After the Watergate cover-up trial, intensive investigation and "
2329,consideration was devoted to possible perjury and obstruction of 
2330,justice by two other persons during the course of the 1972-73 cover-up 
2331,investigation. Evidentiary and legal problems prevented initiation 
2332,of prosecution in these matters. 
2333,Investigation of 18y 2 Minute Tape Gap 
2334,"On October 23, 1973, the White House agreed to provide the U.S. "
2335,"District Court for the District of Columbia with subpoenaed tapes, "
2336,"notes, and memoranda of nine Presidential conversations related to "
2337,"the Watergate cover-up. Seven conversations were produced, but "
2338,White House counsel claimed that the remaining two had not been 
2339,recorded. This assertion led Judge Sirica to hold hearings beginning 
2340,"October 31 to determine the facts. On November 21, while the hearings "
2341,were recessed to await further testimony on the failure to record the 
2342,"two conversations, White House counsel Fred Buzhardt requested "
2343,an in-chambers meeting with Chief Judge John Sirica and attorneys 
2344,"from WSPF. At that meeting, Buzhardt announced that the sub- "
2345,poenaed tape of a conversation between President Nixon and H. R. 
2346,"Haldeman on June 20, 1972 — 3 da}^s after the Watergate break-in — had "
2347,been obliterated inexplicably by a buzzing sound lasting 18% minutes. 
2348,Hal deman's notes of that meeting indicated that the obliterated 
2349,portion of the tape covered only that part of the conversation which 
2350,was related to the break-in. 
2351,52
2352,The discovery of this tape gap led Judge Sirica to reopen the 
2353,"hearings, which continued for 7 days in late November and early "
2354,"December. The President's secretary, Rose Mary Woods, testified "
2355,at the public hearing that she might have accidentally erased 4 or 5 
2356,"minutes of the subpoenaed tape on October 1, 1973, while transcribing "
2357,the conversation. She explained that this possible erasure occurred 
2358,when she inadvertently left her foot on the pedal controlling the tape 
2359,recorder while answering the telephone and conducting a conversation. 
2360,"In addition to Miss Woods' testimony, other White House aides, "
2361,"attorneys, and Secret Service personnel answered questions about "
2362,"the storage of the tape, the methods used to transcribe it, who had "
2363,"access to it, and the discovery of the gap. Testimony and access logs "
2364,"kept by custodians of the tapes revealed that, after being recorded, "
2365,this tape had been routinely placed in a storage vault and not dis- 
2366,"turbed until September 28, 1973, two months after it had been sub- "
2367,poenaed by the grand jury. Any mishandling of the tape appeared 
2368,to have occurred between that date and the discovery of the gap by 
2369,"White House counsel on November 14, 1973. "
2370,"In a further effort to ascertain the cause of the 18% minute gap, "
2371,the court appointed a panel of six experts in acoustics and sound 
2372,engineering approved by the White House and WSPF. The panel 
2373,"was asked to determine the method by which the gap had been created, "
2374,"the kind of machine that had been used to create it, and the existence "
2375,of any possibility of recovering the conversation. The experts began 
2376,various tests on the tape early in December in the presence of repre- 
2377,"sentatives of the White House and WSPF. Their report, delivered to "
2378,"the court January 15, 1974, concluded that the gap had been produced "
2379,by at least five separate hand operations of the stop and record buttons 
2380,"of a Uher 5000 machine, the same model used by Woods in transcribing "
2381,the tape. The panel also concluded that recovery of the obliterated 
2382,conversation would be impossible. 
2383,Since the experts' report made it clear that the gap had been 
2384,"caused by intentional erasures, and evidence produced at the hearings "
2385,showed that the erasures had occurred after the tape had been sub- 
2386,"poenaed, Judge Sirica referred the matter to the grand jury for "
2387,further investigation of the possibility of obstruction of justice. 
2388,"A grand jury, assisted by WSPF and the FBI, began hearing witnesses "
2389,"January 28, 1974. It concluded from the testimony of over 50 people "
2390,that a very small number of persons could have been responsible for 
2391,"the erasures, but it was unable to obtain evidence sufficient to pros- "

2394,Investigation of Submission of Presidential Transcripts 
2395,to House Judiciary Committee 1 
2396,"On April 30, 1974, President Nixon authorized the submission to "
2397,"the House Judiciary Committee, and the release to the public, of a "
2398,number of transcripts of recorded conversations. The Committee had 
2399,subpoenaed the original tapes of these conversations in connection 
2400,"with its impeachment inquiry. At the same time, the President offered "
2401,to allow the Committee's chairman and ranking minority member 
2402,to listen to the original tapes and verify the accuracy and complete- 
2403,ness of the transcripts. The Committee declined this offer. 
2404,The Committee and WSPF had already obtained some of the tapes 
2405,"of conversations included in the transcripts, and comparision of the "
2406,WSPF transcripts with the White House transcripts showed that the 
2407,latter contained several omissions of portions of conversations. The 
2408,prosecutors made some inquiries in the months following the tran- 
2409,"scripts' release, but investigation had to await WSPF's receipt of "
2410,"additional tapes in August 1974, pursuant to the trial subpoena in the "
2411,Watergate cover-up case. A full-scale investigation began early in 1975 
2412,to determine whether various materials were deleted from the tran- 
2413,scripts for the purpose of obstructing the Judiciary Committee's 
2414,"inquiry in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1505. To "
2415,establish a violation of this section it would be necessary to prove that 
2416,portions of the conversations damaging to the President were willfully 
2417,deleted with the corrupt intent to mislead the Committee. 
2418,Certain problems made the necessary elements difficult to prove. 
2419,The Committee already possessed the tapes of several of these con- 
2420,"versations, and as to these, White House deletions in transcripts "
2421,could not mislead or obstruct the Committee. The WSPF investiga- 
2422,"tion thus excluded those transcripts from consideration. Further, "
2423,President Nixon submitted his transcripts with the express statement 
2424,that he was providing only the information that he felt was necessary 
2425,"to Committee business. More significantly, however, in view of the "
2426,White House offer to allow Committee representatives to listen to the 
2427,"tapes for their own verification, corrupt intent was difficult, if not "
2428,"impossible, to establish unless direct proof existed either to negate "
2429,"the bona fides of this Presidential offer to the Committee, or to show "
2430,"an explicitly stated intention to deceive. Finally, the White House "
2431,transcripts carefully noted that deleted material was “not related to 
2432,"Presidential action "" (emphasis supplied). The choice of this language "
2433,to characterize the deletions introduced great ambiguity in the intent 
2434,factor; an advocate could state with literal truth that the Committee 
2435,was put on notice by this language that Watergate-related conversa- 
2436,"1 Although this matter arose as part of the Watergate cover-up investigation, "
2437,the inquiry detailed in this section was conducted by attorneys not assigned to 
2438,the Watergate Task Force. 
2439,54
2440,tions may have been omitted from the transcripts when the conversa- 
2441,tion had not been followed by specific actions. 
2442,This investigation was conducted in large part through the in- 
2443,"terviewing of various witnesses by WSPF and the FBI, outside of the "
2444,grand jury. The investigation began with a comparison of WSPF 
2445,transcripts with those prepared by the White House. Seven or eight 
2446,"deletions were selected which, because of their length and nature, "
2447,could not realistically have been omitted because of a problem in 
2448,audibly determining what was on the tape. WSPF focused the in- 
2449,vestigation on these deletions and attempted to determine why they 
2450,took place. Almost all persons involved in the preparation of the 
2451,transcripts in the White House were interviewed to track the transcrip- 
2452,tion process and the course of decision-making as to the deletions. 
2453,These and other persons were also interviewed in order to check the 
2454,bona fides of the Presidential offer to have Committee representatives 
2455,listen to the entire tape for omissions they thought might be relevant 
2456,to the Committee impeachment inquiry. 
2457,WSPF concluded that there is strong circumstantial evidence 
2458,"that at least some of the lengthy deletions were deliberate, but no "
2459,prosecution was possible. No direct evidence existed to overcome the 
2460,above problems of establishing the necessary criminal intent. In 
2461,"addition, all the available evidence indicated that the verification "
2462,offer by the White House to the Committee was made with full 
2463,expectation that the offer might indeed be accepted. 
2464,"""DIRTY TRICKS"" INVESTIGATION "
2465,In October 1973 several newspapers reported that President 
2466,Nixon’s re-election campaign included an undercover network of 
2467,agents who had engaged in various kinds of political espionage and 
2468,sabotage against candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomina- 
2469,tion. The reported activities came to be known collectively as “dirty 
2470,"tricks,” and included forging letters and other literature which un- "
2471,"fairly attacked some candidates, planting manufactured stories in "
2472,"the press, copying documents from campaign files, and recruiting "
2473,people to ask embarrassing questions at candidates’ rallies or to picket 
2474,such rallies on behalf of opposing candidates. The Washington Post 
2475,identified California lawyer Donald Segretti as the director of these 
2476,operations and reported that he had been recruited and paid by 
2477,White House staff members and re-election campaign aides. 
2478,"The press disclosures, along with complaints by one of the Demo- "
2479,cratic candidates whose Florida primary campaign had been a target 
2480,"of such activities, led the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Middle Dis- "
2481,trict of Florida to conduct an investigation with the help of the FBI. 
2482,"Segretti and George A. Hearing, one of Segretti’s associates, were "
2483,"indicted on May 4, 1973, in Florida on charges of conspiracy and "
2484,distributing campaign literature without properly identifying its 
2485,"source. A week later, Hearing pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a "
2486,year’s imprisonment. 
2487,"Even before Segretti’s indictment in Florida, the Assistant U.S. "
2488,Attorneys conducting the Watergate investigation in Washington 
2489,had interviewed and questioned before the grand jury several former 
2490,White House and re-election campaign officials about his sponsorship. 
2491,"After the appointment of Special Prosecutor Cox, the “dirty tricks” "
2492,investigation was taken over by WSPF. Facing the Florida charges 
2493,"and possible charges in other states, Segretti offered in July to cooper- "
2494,"ate with WSPF, and met with the prosecutors twice that summer, "
2495,giving information that indicated that former White House aide 
2496,Dwight Chapin had lied to the grand jury about his involvement in 
2497,Segretti’s activities. Segretti later pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor 
2498,"charges in Washington, D.C., and was sentenced to serve 6 months "
2499,in prison. 
2500,"The day after his guilty plea, Segretti testified before the grand "
2501,jury under a grant of immunity. His testimony and other evidence 
2502,resulted in Chapin’s indictment on four perjury charges on November 
2503,"29. On April 5, 1974, after trial, Chapin was convicted on two of "
2504,those charges; one of the remaining charges was dismissed during the 
2505,"trial, and the jury acquitted him of the other. Sentenced to serve "
2506,"10 to 30 months in prison, Chapin filed an appeal. On July 14, 1975, "
2507,the Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. 
2508,The Florida investigation had identified several people who had 
2509,engaged in “dirty tricks” as agents of Segretti. Some had been im- 
2510,munized in order to provide the Florida prosecutors with information 
2511,"about Segretti’s own conduct. WSPF’s subsequent investigation, "
2512,"which involved his operations in several states besides Florida, iden- "
2513,tified about 25 people who had engaged in various activities on his 
2514,instructions. Most of them had engaged in conduct that was not 
2515,"criminal — for example, supplying Segretti with local news clippings, "
2516,"asking embarrassing questions at candidates’ public appearances, "
2517,"peacefully picketing events at which candidates were to appear, "
2518,putting Segretti in touch with other possible agents. Those who 
2519,had engaged in more serious conduct such as distributing misattributed 
2520,"literature, were generally young people who had done so without "
2521,"knowing it was illegal. Because of their youth, the marginal and "
2522,"isolated nature of their criminality, if any, and their low level of "
2523,"influence in Segretti’s operation, WSPF did not seek to prosecute "
2524,these persons. 
2525,"Other allegations, including those made in the press and in testi- "
2526,"mony before the Senate Select Committee, indicated that various "
2527,other “dirty tricks” had been perpetrated against Democratic cam- 
2528,paigns by people working on behalf of the President’s re-election. 
2529,56
2530,WSPF investigated these allegations and found either that they did 
2531,not involve criminal conduct or that the filing of criminal charges 
2532,was not warranted by the facts uncovered. 
2533,The prosecutors also received allegations about possible “dirty 
2534,tricks” by agents of Democratic candidates directed against President 
2535,Nixon’s campaign. Most of these involved the possible use of Demo- 
2536,cratic candidates’ headquarters and facilities in organizing demon- 
2537,strations that disrupted public appearances of the President or of 
2538,persons campaigning on his behalf. The most substantial of these 
2539,charges was that Senator George McGovern’s Los Angeles campaign 
2540,headquarters and telephone bank had been used in organizing a large 
2541,demonstration at the Century Plaza Hotel when the President ap- 
2542,peared there in September 1972. As to this and the other matters 
2543,"they investigated, the prosecutors did not obtain sufficient evidence "
2544,to bring criminal charges. 
2545,INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO 
2546,INTERNATIONAL TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CORPORATION 
2547,"During the spring of 1972, while the Senate Judiciary Committee "
2548,was considering the nomination of Richard Kleindienst to be Attorney 
2549,"General, press accounts suggested that the Department of Justice "
2550,had settled three antitrust suits in 1971 against International Tele- 
2551,"phone and Telegraph Corporation (ITT), one of the Nation’s largest "
2552,"conglomerates, in return for ITT’s alleged offer to help finance the "
2553,1972 Republican National Convention. The Committee questioned 
2554,"Kleindienst, other Government officials, officers of ITT, and others "
2555,"with relevant knowledge about the matter, and then requested the "
2556,Justice Department to investigate the possibility that perjury had been 
2557,committed in its hearings. 
2558,"After WSPF was established, Attorney General Richardson, who "
2559,"had succeeded Kleindienst, asked Special Prosecutor Cox to look into "
2560,the possibility that perjury had been committed in the 1972 hearings 
2561,(the Justice Department’s investigation had made little progress in 
2562,"the preceding year), as well as the possible relationship between the "
2563,antitrust settlements and ITT’s pledges of support for the Republican 
2564,"convention. He also asked Cox to investigate an allegation, referred "
2565,to the Justice Department by the Securities and Exchange Com- 
2566,"mission (SEC), that a Commission inquiry had been obstructed by "
2567,ITT’s failure to produce certain documents. An ITT task force was 
2568,organized within WSPF to conduct these inquiries. 
2569,"Later, in response to additional referrals from the Justice Depart- "
2570,"ment and information received from other sources, the ITT task force "
2571,also investigated charges that: 
2572,— The Kleindienst confirmation hearings had been illegally 
2573,obstructed; 
2574,57
2575,— Crimes had been committed in connection with the transfer of 
2576,documents relating to ITT from the SEC to the Justice Department 
2577,at a time when a House Commerce Subcommittee was seeking such 
2578,documents and in connection with subsequent Subcommittee hear- 
2579,ings inquiring into the circumstances of the transfer; 
2580,— ITT had been granted a favorable tax ruling by the Internal 
2581,Revenue Service as a result of improper influence or fraud; 
2582,— Improper influence had been applied to the Justice Depar tment’s 
2583,"handling of the antitrust suits against ITT, apart from the 1971 "
2584,settlement ; 
2585,— Improper influence had been used in securing the agreement of 
2586,another corporation to merge with ITT and in obtaining necessary 
2587,approvals of that merger; 
2588,— Perjury had been committed by various people before Congres- 
2589,"sional committees, the SEC, and the grand jury. "
2590,The investigation into the ITT-related matters occupied several 
2591,attorneys for approximately 18 months. Investigation of the antitrust 
2592,cases involved an examination of the July 1971 settlements and 
2593,improper attempts to influence these settlements. The cases involved 
2594,Government challenges to ITT’s proposed mergers with the Canteen 
2595,"Corporation (filed in April 1969), the Hartford Fire Insurance Com- "
2596,"pany (filed on August 1, 1969), and the Grinnell Corporation (filed "
2597,"on August 1, 1969). While other events were also examined, the "
2598,principal focus was on determining whether illegal influence was exer- 
2599,cised (1) to prevent the filing of the Canteen case or cause the Govern- 
2600,ment not to seek preliminary relief enjoining that merger; (2) to con- 
2601,vince the Government in the summer and fall of 1970 either to drop 
2602,the cases entirely or accept a settlement involving no meaningful 
2603,divestiture; (3) to prevent or delay the filing of an appeal in the 
2604,Grinnell case to the Supreme Court; and (4) to cause the settlement 
2605,of all three cases in July 1971. 
2606,In each of these instances the evidence accumulated by WSPF 
2607,"showed that ITT had gained access, directly or indirectly, to important "
2608,Administration officials who in some instances took some action 
2609,relating to these cases. In only one instance did the effort to secure 
2610,high-level influence produce a provable impact on the handling of the 
2611,"cases. The further task, however, was to discover whether these "
2612,"attempts to influence the case were corrupt, such as the result of a "
2613,"bribe, or whether they were the product of an intensive though legal "
2614,lobbying effort. Those whose conduct was examined in this connection 
2615,"included persons who sought the assistance of Administration officials, "
2616,the officials who discussed these cases with people outside the Govern- 
2617,"ment, and those with high-level responsibility for the cases who dealt "
2618,with Administration officials. 
2619,The investigation relating to the Kleindienst confirmation hearings 
2620,focused on two areas : first and more significant was whether any wit- 
2621,58
2622,"ness at the hearings had committed perjun ; second, whether the "
2623,"hearings were obstructed illegally. In the search for possible perjury, "
2624,the investigators examined the testimony of every witness who testi- 
2625,fied about the ITT antitrust cases and the San Diego convention 
2626,pledge. 
2627,The obstruction inquiry is more difficult to define. It was clear 
2628,that the Judiciary Committee did not receive the complete “story” 
2629,during its hearings and did not obtain substantial numbers of per- 
2630,tinent ITT and Government (White House and Justice Department) 
2631,documents. The goal of WSPF was to discover why this took place 
2632,and whether the facts involved illegal defiance of Committee process or 
2633,acts sufficient to constitute a violation of the criminal obstruction laws. 
2634,"In June 1972, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a "
2635,case against ITT and certain of its officers in which a consent judg- 
2636,"ment was entered. In September and October 1972, the SEC began "
2637,to examine whether ITT had improperly withheld subpoenaed docu- 
2638,"ments. When, in October 1972, a House Commerce Committee sub- "
2639,"committee requested the SEC's ITT files, the SEC suddenly trans- "
2640,"ferred the case to the Justice Department together with the files, "
2641,including documents showing significant contacts between ITT and 
2642,important Administration officials. WSPF investigated the matter to 
2643,determine whether this transfer was an illegal obstruction of the 
2644,"House subcommittee, whether anyone committed perjury at the "
2645,"various hearings held by the subcommittee into the transfer, and "
2646,whether the SEC was improperly influenced to omit a fraud charge 
2647,from its 1972 case. Also examined was ITT's failure to produce docu- 
2648,ments from its Washington office in response to the SEC's subpoena. 
2649,WSPF also investigated the circumstances under which ITT 
2650,received favorable tax treatment for its merger with the Hartford Fire 
2651,Insurance Company. The IRS ruled in October 1969 that ITT had to 
2652,divest its holdings in that company's shares prior to the stockholders' 
2653,"meeting. Later that month, IRS ruled that a contract involving the "
2654,“transfer” of these shares to an Italian bank (Mediobanca) was a 
2655,"sufficient sale of the shares under the earlier ruling. In fact, it was "
2656,"questionable whether this contract involved a true sale, especially "
2657,when the circumstances relating to its negotiation became clear. 
2658,WSPF has focused on whether these tax rulings were the product of 
2659,"improper influence, whether ITT or its representatives were guilty of "
2660,criminally defrauding the Government by misrepresenting the facts 
2661,"relating to the stock transfer, and whether witnesses who testified "
2662,about the transaction before the SEC had committed perjury. Al- 
2663,though the WSPF inquiry in the area of improper influence is com- 
2664,"pleted, the SEC investigation is continuing with a new evidentiary "
2665,focus as to the transfer of shares. 
2666,During its original investigation the Securities and Exchange 
2667,Commission had also looked into certain events related to the eventual 
2668,merger of ITT and Hartford. Although no attempt was made to redo 
2669,"all that the SEC had covered in their investigation, WSPF also "
2670,conducted its own investigations of these matters. 
2671,"Finally, the ITT task force also examined testimony before the "
2672,Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Multinational Corpora- 
2673,tion’s hearings into ITT’s activities in Chile during 1970 and 1971 
2674,"to determine, among other considerations, whether a particular witness "
2675,"had committed perjury. Additionally, the ITT task force spent "
2676,substantial time investigating possible grand jury perjuries committed 
2677,during its inquiries. 
2678,The investigations of the ITT task force resulted in two criminal 
2679,"cases. In the first case, former Attorney General Richard Kleindienst "
2680,"pleaded guilty on May 16, 1974, to a charge of failing to give accurate "
2681,"testimony at his 1972 confirmation hearings, regarding White House "
2682,influence on the antitrust suit. He was fined $100 and given a sus- 
2683,"pended 30-day jail term. In the second case, California Lieutenant "
2684,"Governor Ed Reinecke was convicted after trial on July 27, 1974, "
2685,of one count of perjury in connection with his testimony at the same 
2686,"hearings. He received a suspended 18-month sentence, and the "
2687,conviction is now on appeal. 
2688,"In the remaining areas of the ITT task force, pursuant to the "
2689,"factors discussed in Chapter 2 of this report, no prosecutions were "
2690,"brought. Primarily, this result occurred because there was insufficient "
2691,"evidence to allow the initiation of a criminal case. Also, as noted above, "
2692,the SEC continues to investigate one aspect of the ITT matter. 
2693,"""PLUMBERS"" INVESTIGATION "
2694,Fielding Break-In 
2695,In the course of investigating the Watergate case in the spring 
2696,"of 1973, Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the District of Columbia learned "
2697,from former White House counsel John Dean that a special investi- 
2698,"gative unit in the White House, known as the “Plumbers,” had been "
2699,responsible for a break-in in September 1971 at the Los Angeles offices 
2700,"of Dr. Lewis Fielding, conducted to secure the psychiatric records "
2701,"of Fielding’s former patient, Daniel Ellsberg. At the time of the break- "
2702,"in, Ellsberg was under indictment for his role in the alleged theft of "
2703,the classified “Pentagon Papers”. 
2704,"By the time WSPF was established, the investigation showed "
2705,that “Plumbers” Gordon Liddy and Howard Hunt had planned the 
2706,"burglary, that some of their Cub an -American associates had carried "
2707,"it out, and that White House aides Egil Krogh and David Young "
2708,"had obtained the approval of another White House staff member, "
2709,"John Ehrlichman, for the project. Hunt had been given immunity "
2710,from further prosecution after his Watergate conviction and Young 
2711,60
2712,had been immunized in order to obtain his cooperation in the Fielding 
2713,"investigation. During the summer of 1973, WSPF’s “Plumbers” "
2714,task force continued this investigation. 
2715,"On September 4, 1973, a Los Angeles County grand jury which "
2716,had also been investigating the break-in returned an indictment 
2717,"charging Ehrlichman, Krogh, Liddy, and Young with conspiracy "
2718,"and burglary, Krogh with solicitation to commit burglary, and "
2719,Ehrlichman with perjury in connection with his testimony before 
2720,the Los Angleles grand jury. After consultation with WSPF and 
2721,"attorneys for the defendants, the District Attorney in Los Angeles "
2722,agreed not to press the case to trial pending the outcome of WSPF’s 
2723,investigation. 
2724,"On October 11, 1973, a Federal grand jury in Washington indicted "
2725,Krogh on two counts of perjury. These charges were dropped on 
2726,"November 30, following Krogh’s plea to a charge of having conspired "
2727,to violate Dr. Fielding’s civil rights and his agreement to cooperate 
2728,"with WSPF. On January 24, 1974, Krogh was sentenced to serve "
2729,"2 to 6 years in prison, with all but 6 months of the term suspended. "
2730,"WSPF’s investigation culminated in the March 7, 1974, indictment "
2731,"of Ehrlichmen, former White House aide Charles Colson, Liddy, "
2732,"Bernard Barker, Eugenio Martinez, and Felipe DeDiego on charges "
2733,of conspiring to violate Dr. Fielding’s civil rights. Ehrlichman also 
2734,was charged with lying to the FBI and three counts of perjury in 
2735,connection with the Federal investigation. 
2736,"Colson, who also had been indicted in connection with the Water- "
2737,"gate cover-up, began discussions with the prosecutors in May to "
2738,dispose of both matters. An agreement was eventually reached 
2739,whereby he pleaded guilty on June 3 to a felony charge of obstructing 
2740,"justice, based on his efforts to obtain and disseminate derogatory "
2741,information about Ellsberg with intent to impede Ellsberg’s pending 
2742,criminal trial. Colson also agreed to cooperate in WSPF’s investi- 
2743,"gations and prosecutions and on June 21, he was sentenced to a "
2744,1- to 3-year prison term. The other charges against him in the Fielding 
2745,and Watergate cases were dismissed. 
2746,"During pre-trial proceedings in the Fielding case, Ehrlichman "
2747,maintained that he had not known in advance that Dr. Fielding’s 
2748,office would be broken into and that the effort to collect information 
2749,about Ellsberg had been a legitimate attempt to protect the national 
2750,security. Arguing that White House files contained evidence which 
2751,"might support his contentions, his attorneys obtained a subpoena "
2752,for notes and classified White House documents. When White House 
2753,resistance to this subpoena threatened to lead to a dismissal of charges 
2754,"against him, his case was severed for a brief period until White House "
2755,counsel submitted an affidavit that the files contained no material 
2756,of an exculpatory nature. 
2757,61
2758,591-439 0 - 75 -5 
2759,"Shortly before trial, DeDiego moved for dismissal of the charges "
2760,"against him, claiming that the evidence which would be used against "
2761,him was based on immunized testimony he had given to a Florida 
2762,"prosecutor. Judge Gerhard Gesell, to whom the case had been as- "
2763,"signed, granted the motion. WSPF successfully appealed this decision "
2764,on the ground that an evidentiary hearing should precede a dismissal. 
2765,But the prosecutors later dropped the charges because the immunized 
2766,testimony raised doubts about the probability of a successful trial. 
2767,The matter was transferred to Department of Justice lawyers who 
2768,were “untainted” because they had had no access to DeDiego’ s 
2769,immunized account. 
2770,The Fielding jury trial lasted 3 weeks and resulted in a guilty 
2771,"verdict on July 12, 1974, against all remaining defendants, with the "
2772,exception of a not guilty verdict on one of the three perjury charges 
2773,"against Ehrlichman. Judge Gesell, in dismissing one charge against "
2774,"Ehrlichman of lying to the FBI, held that the statute he was accused "
2775,of violating did not extend to the FBI investigative interview under 
2776,"the kinds of circumstances shown at the trial. On July 31, Barker "
2777,"and Martinez, who had spent substantial time in jail following their "
2778,"conviction in the original Watergate case, received suspended sen- "
2779,tences and 3 years’ probation. Liddy was sentenced to a 1- to 3-year 
2780,prison term and Ehrlichman to a term of 20 months to 5 years. All 
2781,defendants have appealed their convictions. 
2782,Other Break-In Investigations 
2783,Newspaper reports in early 1973 suggested that the participants 
2784,in the Watergate break-in might also have burglarized the Embassy 
2785,"of Chile in Washington, D.C., on the weekend of May 13-15, 1972, "
2786,and the homes of Chilean diplomats in New York City earlier in 1972. 
2787,"The “Plumbers” task force investigated these allegations, inter- "
2788,"viewing the Watergate burglars, officials of the embassy, local police "
2789,"officers, members of a Senate committee staff, former officials of the "
2790,"White House and the Central Intelligence Agency, and journalists. "
2791,"The State Department, CIA, and FBI also provided information in "
2792,connection with this incident. The investigation did not develop 
2793,evidence which would form a basis for criminal charges. 
2794,WSPF also received allegations from various sources that the 
2795,White House “Plumbers” or other agents had been responsible for 
2796,"numerous unsolved burglaries in the Washington, D.C., area and "
2797,elsewhere. The victims of these burglaries had been persons or 
2798,organizations that might be deemed hostile to the Nixon Administra- 
2799,tion. The task force’s investigations were directed at determining 
2800,whether there was evidence that the “Plumbers” or other known 
2801,White House agents had been involved in any of these burglaries. 
2802,"No such evidence was found, and no criminal charges were brought. "
2803,62
2804,Wiretap Investigations 
2805,Press reports in May 1973 alleged that between 1969 and 1971 the 
2806,"FBI, at the direction of the White House, conducted wiretaps directed "
2807,at a number of Government officials and newsmen in an effort to 
2808,discover the sources of unauthorized disclosures of information related 
2809,to the national security. It was also a leged that some of these wiretaps 
2810,had been conducted in connection with the investigation of the dis- 
2811,closure of the “Pentagon Papers.” These reports prompted Judge 
2812,"W. Matthew Byrne, then presiding at the criminal trial of Daniel "
2813,"Ellsberg, to order the Justice Department to determine whether or "
2814,"not such wiretapping had occurred, and to produce in court all wiretap "
2815,evidence in any way related to the Ellsberg case. 
2816,"William D. Ruckelshaus, the new Acting Director of the FBI, "
2817,launched an intensive investigation to determine whether such wiretap 
2818,"evidence existed. On May 10, 1973, Ruckelshaus informed Judge "
2819,Byrne that his investigation had determined that such a wiretap 
2820,"project had taken place, that an FBI employee recalled that during "
2821,the course of a wiretap on the home phone of Dr. Morton Halperin 2 
2822,at least one telephone conversation of Daniel Ellsberg had been 
2823,"recorded, and that the FBI had not been able to locate the records of "
2824,"these wiretaps. The following day, May 11, Judge Byrne declared a "
2825,mistrial and dismissed all charges against Ellsberg and his co-defendant 
2826,"on the ground of Government misconduct, citing both the Fielding "
2827,burglary and the failure of the Government to produce the records of 
2828,the electronic surveillance of Ellsberg. The following day all records of 
2829,the wiretap project were located among the White House files of John 
2830,"Ehrlichman and were returned to the FBI. On May 14, 1973, Ruckels- "
2831,haus held a press conference and revealed that the wiretap project had 
2832,"been conducted from May 1969 to February 1971, that a total of 13 "
2833,Government officials and four journalists had been subject to electronic 
2834,"surveillance, and that in the summer or fall of 1971 all records of the "
2835,wiretap project had been removed from the FBI and delivered to 
2836,Ehrlichman at the White House. 
2837,WSPF began its investigation into the events surrounding the 
2838,"wiretap project in the late summer of 1973. Press reports, principally "
2839,"in the New York Times , had listed the names of 17 individuals alleged "
2840,to have been the subjects of these wiretaps. Because some of the 
2841,Government officials alleged to have been the subjects of these 
2842,"wiretaps had worked in purely domestic areas, WSPF first inquired "
2843,whether or not these wiretaps had been authorized by the Attorney 
2844,"2 Dr. Halperin, a former assistant to Dr. Henry Kissinger, later filed a civil "
2845,damage suit against Kissinger and others alleging that the wiretapping of Hal- 
2846,perin’s phone had been illegal. A number of facts concerning the wiretap project 
2847,have been made public as a result of the depositions taken in the Halperin v. 
2848,Kissinger litigation. That case is still pending and further depositions may produce 
2849,additional public information. 
2850,63
2851,"General and, even if authorized, whether that authorization had been "
2852,"given on the basis of good faith, legitimate national security concerns. 3 "
2853,It had also been alleged that the wiretap on one of the Government 
2854,officials had continued after he left the Government to work as a 
2855,policy adviser for a Democratic Senator then seeking the Presidential 
2856,"nomination. This fact, along with certain documents received by "
2857,"WSPF, 4 also led WSPF to question whether these wiretaps had been "
2858,"used to develop partisan political intelligence, and in addition, "
2859,whether or not any wiretap information had been “leaked” to the 
2860,press or otherwise disclosed. (Disclosure of wiretap information is 
2861,itself a violation of the wiretapping statute.) The continuing investiga- 
2862,tion finally focused on whether various Government officials had 
2863,"concealed the existence of these wiretaps to obstruct justice — i.e., to "
2864,prevent the disclosure of the electronic surveillance of Ellsberg— or 
2865,had concealed the existence of these wiretaps by illegal means such as 
2866,perjury. 
2867,"During September and October 1973, WSPF considered requesting "
2868,direct access to the wiretap files that Ruckelshaus had brought back 
2869,to the FBI. Special Prosecutor Cox was asked by the FBI to route any 
2870,such request directly to the Attorney General since the FBI felt that 
2871,it could not comply with such a request unless instructed to do so by 
2872,the Attorney General. Cox decided to hold off further negotiations on 
2873,this issue until after conclusion of the litigation over grand jury access 
2874,to Presidential tape recordings. In the interim. WSPF made an initial 
2875,determination as to which wiretaps appeared to lack proper national 
2876,"security justification, and attorneys interviewed individuals who had "
2877,allegedly been the subjects of these questionable wiretaps. 
2878,"After Cox was fired, Jaworski sought and gained access to the wire- "
2879,tap files. The files were reviewed in December 1973 and the following 
2880,"month, WSPF began presenting witnesses on this matter to the newly "
2881,empaneled grand jury. The prosecutors examined voluminous FBI 
2882,"records, interviewed current and former FBI and Justice Department "
2883,"personnel, secured grand jury testimony, and spoke with others who "
2884,were believed to have relevant knowledge. 
2885,"In the summer of 1974, the prosecutors expanded their investiga- "
2886,tion by obtaining the assistance of FBI agents assigned to the General 
2887,"Investigative Division. 5 Thereafter, FBI agents conducted most of "
2888,3 Warrantless wiretapping on grounds of domestic (as opposed to foreign) 
2889,threats to national security was not ruled illegal until a Supreme Court decision 
2890,in June 1972. 
2891,"4 See House Judiciary Report, Book VII, Part I, pp. 360-364, where sub- "
2892,stantial portions of the documents referred to have been published. 
2893,5 This arrangement was satisfactory to both the FBI and WSPF since the 
2894,General Investigative Division had jurisdiction to investigate the types of 
2895,"criminal activity in question, and in addition, that division of the FBI had had "
2896,"no previous dealings with the wiretap project, which had been handled exclusively "
2897,by the FBI’s Intelligence Division. 
2898,64
2899,the initial interviews of witnesses. The investigation of wiretaps 
2900,"initiated by the White House, and the subsequent concealment of the "
2901,"nature and records of that activity, involved the full time of one "
2902,attorney and part of the time of another over an 18-month period. 
2903,The “Plumbers” task force also looked into a number of allega- 
2904,tions of non -FBI wiretapping which was alleged to have been illegal. 
2905,The most significant of these inquiries was the alleged wiretapping 
2906,"for 2 weeks of the home telephone of Joseph Kraft, a syndicated "
2907,"columnist, first revealed in June 1973 by John Dean’s testimony "
2908,before the Senate Select Committee. The investigation included 
2909,"interviews of former White House, FBI, and telephone company "
2910,"officials, an interview of Mr. Kraft, and a review of relevant White "
2911,House and FBI documents. 
2912,The Counsel to the Special Prosecutor examined the various 
2913,"legal issues involved in these wiretap investigations, and concluded: "
2914,. . . Congress has specifically provided in 18 U.S.C.. Section 
2915,2511(3) that the statutory prohibition against wiretapping does 
2916,not apply to measures the President believes necessary “to protect 
2917,national security information against foreign intelligence activ- 
2918,ities.” Whether any of the taps in question fit within this exception 
2919,could be debated as a matter of statutory interpretation as well 
2920,"as a matter of actual intention, and there would also be room to "
2921,contend that the duration of some of the taps showed that even 
2922,an initially legitimate purpose was altered to an impermissable 
2923,domestic political goal. 
2924,"Nevertheless, because of the numerous uncertainties in this "
2925,"area, I would be hesitant to recommend a criminal prosecution "
2926,of any of the principals involved in initiating what appeared to 
2927,be “national security” wiretaps. 
2928,WSPF investigators and Counsel concluded that at least two of 
2929,"the wiretaps, unlike those addressed in counsel’s opinion above, had "
2930,"little, if any, “national security” justification. As to these, however, "
2931,"after investigation by WSPF and the FBI, there was insufficient "
2932,"evidence to bring criminal charges, particularly when weighed against "
2933,other matters under inquiry by WSPF as to some of the subjects 
2934,of the wiretap investigation. 
2935,Alleged Misuse of Federal Agencies 
2936,"Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In the summer of 1973, the Senate "
2937,Select Committee heard testimony that members of the White House 
2938,staff had made various attempts to use the powers of the Internal 
2939,Revenue Service to further President Nixon’s political interests. 
2940,"Former White House counsel John Dean, among others, testified "
2941,"about an “enemies project,” which sought “to use the available "
2942,65
2943,"Federal machinery,” including the audit and investigative powers of "
2944,"the IRS, against individuals and organizations viewed as “enemies” "
2945,and on behalf of individuals viewed as “friends” of the Nixon 
2946,Administration. 
2947,Because these allegations related to abuses of governmental 
2948,"power similar to the activities of the White House “Plumbers,” their "
2949,investigation was assigned in August 1973 to attorneys in the 
2950,“Plumbers” task force of WSPF. The prosecutors began to examine 
2951,the matters raised by the Senate hearings and by related allegations. 
2952,"For example, a lawsuit brought by the Center for Corporate Re ponsi- "
2953,bility claimed that its tax-exempt status had been revoked illegally 
2954,because of its position on various social and economic issues; and 
2955,various people who had assumed public positions in opposition to 
2956,Nixon Administration policies complained that they had been sub- 
2957,jected to repeated audits or other forms of harassment by the IRS. 
2958,The prosecutors began their investigation by familiarizing them- 
2959,"selves with IRS operations, including the normal procedures for "
2960,"initiating audits, and by attempting to determine which of the many "
2961,"allegations appeared to have the most substance and, if true, would "
2962,form the basis for criminal prosecutions. In this process they inter- 
2963,viewed a number of former and current IRS officials who provided 
2964,information on IRS procedures and in some cases also provided facts 
2965,giving rise to new inquiries. 
2966,Although a large number of allegations about possible misuses of 
2967,"the IRS were investigated, the prosecutors made their most extensive "
2968,inquiries in two areas — the alleged efforts of White House aides in 
2969,"1972 to get the IRS to audit and harass Lawrence F. O’Brien, Sr., "
2970,"then the chairman for the Democratic National Committee, and "
2971,alleged attempts by White House officials to influence the IRS to 
2972,audit various “enemies” of the Administration and act favorably 
2973,toward certain “friends” of the Administration. During these investi- 
2974,"gations, the prosecutors received relevant information from the IRS "
2975,"itself, which had conducted its own “in-house” inquiries, and from the "
2976,staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Internal Revenue 
2977,"Taxation, which had conducted investigations of matters raised in the "
2978,Senate hearings. 
2979,From the beginning of both of these investigations the prose- 
2980,cutors faced two substantial problems which made any eventual 
2981,"prosecution unlikely. First, even if evidence tending to confirm the "
2982,"allegations was developed (and in man}^ cases it was), it would have "
2983,been difficult to prove the specific intent required to establish a vio- 
2984,"lation of Federal law, in this case, a conspiracy to defraud the United "
2985,"States in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. § 371. In theory, any concerted "
2986,effort to use Government resources for illegitimate and political — 
2987,66
2988,perhaps punitive — purposes would seem to constitute a violation of 
2989,"this provision; but in practice, proof beyond a reasonable doubt of "
2990,the requisite corrupt intent is difficult where there are objective indi- 
2991,cators in each case to support the argument that an audit of an 
2992,"“enemy” was, in fact, in order and consistent with normal IRS "
2993,"standards. Moreover, none of the incidents in question involved evi- "
2994,dence of payoffs or other corrupt practices. 
2995,A second problem hindering successful investigation arose from 
2996,the fact that there were numerous inquiries and investigations by 
2997,other agencies concerning the matters under investigation by WSPF. 
2998,This often resulted in those principally involved learning substantially 
2999,all details of the matters WSPF was investigating even before WSPI — 
3000,and/or the grand juries — came to deal with them. These individuals 
3001,were able to smooth conflicting testimony and otherwise embroider 
3002,explanations which made continued investigation by WSPF difficult. 
3003,Some witnesses who were dealing with WSPF often were close and 
3004,long-time associates of those under investigation. 
3005,Despite these problems the grand jury’s investigations did go 
3006,far in detailing the facts of what had transpired in the area of White 
3007,"House abuse of the IRS. Indeed, in fully investigating the facts of "
3008,"the two specific incidents noted above, WSPF and the grand juries "
3009,received the testimony of perhaps a hundred or so witnesses. It was 
3010,"concluded ultimately, however, that there was insufficient evidence "
3011,and/or substantial legal problems mitigating against the bringing of 
3012,any criminal charges. 
3013,White House “ Responsiveness Program ” and Related Matters. Evi- 
3014,dence obtained by the Senate Select Committee and provided to 
3015,WSPF in 1974 indicated that as part of a “Responsiveness Program” 
3016,"conducted by a staff unit in the White House, certain White House "
3017,"staff members had attempted in 1972 to channel Federal grants, "
3018,"contracts, loans, subsidies, and other benefits to persons and organi- "
3019,"sations supporting President Nixon’s re-election campaign, and to "
3020,withhold such benefits from those opposing his candidacy. Two in- 
3021,stances of possible criminal conduct were alleged to have taken place 
3022,pursuant to the “Responsiveness Program”: the dropping of an anti- 
3023,discrimination suit brought b}^ the Equal Employment Opportunity 
3024,Commission and the rescinding of a Labor Department subpoena 
3025,directed at a union which was supporting the President. The prose- 
3026,cutors began their inquiry by obtaining background information and 
3027,the names of about 30 people who had served as White House contacts 
3028,in the various agencies for the “ Responsiveness Program.” The 
3029,prosecutors then requested the FBI to interview White House staff 
3030,"members allegedly involved, the agency contacts and other witnesses. "
3031,67
3032,One of the prosecutors also reviewed the Labor Departments files 
3033,regarding the rescinded subpoena. 
3034,When additional White House documents became available to 
3035,"WSPF in spring of 1975, various files were searched for documents "
3036,relating to the “ Responsiveness Program” in a further effort to learn 
3037,whether violations of laws had occurred. On the basis of this investi- 
3038,"gation, it was concluded that certain memoranda obtained by the "
3039,Senate Select Committee had exaggerated the effect of the “Respon- 
3040,"siveness Program” and, accordingly, no criminal charges resulted from "
3041,WSPF’s inquiries. 
3042,A similar investigation probed an allegation that the Department 
3043,"of Labor had delayed, and, in some matters, also denied the promul- "
3044,gation of various occupational health and safety standards in return 
3045,for contributions to the President’s campaign. A memorandum un- 
3046,covered by Senate Select Committee investigators appeared to sub- 
3047,stantiate this charge and led the prosecutors to ask the FBI to inter- 
3048,view about 10 individuals about the matter. One witness was also 
3049,called before the grand jury. It was concluded on the basis of this 
3050,investigation that no violations of criminal law occurred. 
3051,The prosecutors also received allegations in March 1974 that White 
3052,"House officials, for the purpose of assisting President Nixon’s re- "
3053,"election efforts, had set up the Federation of Experienced Americans "
3054,"(FEA), an organization sponsoring programs for elderly citizens, and "
3055,had made efforts to shift Federal funding to FEA from the National 
3056,"Council on Senior Citizens and the National Council on Aging, two "
3057,"established organizations of the same type, which had not supported "
3058,the President’s policies and were not expected to support his re-election 
3059,"campaign. The General Accounting Office (GAO), had conducted an "
3060,earlier investigation of FEA and found that White House officials 
3061,had brought pressure on Federal agencies to award funds to FEA 
3062,and had helped it to obtain a donation from a corporation. The GAO 
3063,investigation resulted in the termination of Federal funds to FEA 
3064,because of financial improprieties. The prosecutors reviewed the GAO’s 
3065,"files and, at WSPF’s request, FBI agents interviewed more than 40 "
3066,Government agency employees and White House and FEA officials 
3067,about possible White House efforts to channel funds to FEA and 
3068,possible FEA activities in support of the President’s 1972 campaign. 
3069,No evidence was developed to support criminal charges. 
3070,Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of Demonstrators 
3071,"Investigation Into an Assault on Antiwar Demonstrators, Newspaper "
3072,"articles appearing in June 1973, and information obtained in the "
3073,"early stages of the Watergate investigation, suggested that officials "
3074,of the White House and the Committee to Re-Elect the President 
3075,had directed an organized assault on antiwar demonstrators on the 
3076,"steps of the Capitol building on the evening of May 3, 1972. "
3077,The antiwar demonstration in question featured a number of 
3078,"leading antiwar activists. Coincidentally, but unrelated to the demon- "
3079,"stration or the assault, a public viewing of former FBI Director "
3080,J. Edgar Hoover's coffin in the Capitol Rotunda took place a short 
3081,distance from the site of the antiwar demonstration. 
3082,"The early stages of WSPF's investigation, which began in July "
3083,"1973, revealed that a group of 10 individuals, some of whom had "
3084,been involved in the break-in of Dr. Fielding’s office in California 
3085,and some of whom subsequently became involved in the illegal 
3086,entries into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at 
3087,"the Watergate complex, had been present during the assault. Their "
3088,"transportation from Miami was financed with $3,200 in campaign "
3089,funds. 
3090,"On the basis of this and other evidence, WSPF conducted an "
3091,extensive investigation into this incident because of the allegations 
3092,that the assault had been ordered by White House officials and be- 
3093,cause of the close connection between this event and the first Water- 
3094,gate break-in 3 weeks later. It was also considered significant that 
3095,the original $1 million plan from which the Watergate burglary evolved 
3096,included a proposal for mugging squads to rough up demonstrators. 
3097,"Thus, the investigation sought to determine any existence or implemen- "
3098,tation of a general plan to use paid operatives for the purpose of violent 
3099,activity against demonstrators and other anti- Administration activists. 
3100,"Accordingly, more than 150 witnesses were interviewed including "
3101,"victims of the assault, witnesses to it, police officers, and White "
3102,House and CRP personnel. Witnesses who resided a long distance 
3103,from Washington and those of less significance were interviewed by 
3104,"the FBI. Of those interviewed, some testified before the grand jury. "
3105,A request for a thorough search of White House documents relevant 
3106,"to this investigation was made by Cox in October 1973, but relevant "
3107,materials were not made available to WSPF until the spring of 1975. 
3108,This investigation consumed a substantial portion of the time of 
3109,two attorneys over a 6-month period. On the basis of several factors 
3110,"cited in Chapter 2, no criminal charges were brought. "
3111,Investigation o f Alleged Mistreatment of Demonstrators at Presidential 
3112,Appearances . A newspaper story in August 1973 alleged that persons 
3113,who appeared to be demonstrators against or opponents of the Nixon 
3114,Administration had been excluded or removed from the public coli- 
3115,"seum in Charlotte, N.C., on the occasion of the President's appearance "
3116,"there on October 15, 1971, and that this activity had been conducted "
3117,by local volunteers from the Veterans of Foreign Wars recruited by 
3118,White House advancemen. The prosecutors had previously been told 
3119,that advancemen had made similar attempts to keep demonstrators 
3120,away from the President as he made public appearances around the 
3121,69
3122,"country, and they then interviewed a former advanceman about these "
3123,"general allegations. After the publication of the newspaper story, "
3124,WSPF received from a citizens’ group a report containing specific 
3125,allegations of mistreatment of demonstrators at various Presidential 
3126,"appearances, including the Charlotte incident, from 1971 to 1973. "
3127,WSPF investigated these charges through office and FBI inter- 
3128,views of former CRP and White House officials including the advance- 
3129,"men, and through an examination of White House tapes and docu- "
3130,ments which became available in the spring of 1975. Some of the 
3131,witnesses were questioned before a grand jury. 
3132,"In mid-September 1973, Cox learned that the Civil Rights Di- "
3133,vision of the Justice Department was also investigating some of these 
3134,"same allegations. As a result, arrangements were made between this "
3135,office and the Civil Rights Division for a joint effort in which in- 
3136,vestigative responsibilities were divided between the two offices. 
3137,"Major witnesses, however, were interviewed by two attorneys working "
3138,"together, one from WSPF and one from Civil Rights. The investiga- "
3139,"tion, conducted over approximately a 3-month period, did not result "
3140,in the proof of criminal activity. 
3141,Investigation of President Nixon's Tax Returns 
3142,Newspaper articles appearing in the summer and fall of 1973 
3143,indicated that President Nixon had paid minimal Federal taxes on 
3144,substantial income earned during the period 1969 to 1972 because of a 
3145,deduction he had taken for the purported gift of his Pre-Presidential 
3146,papers to the National Archives. The White House claimed that the 
3147,papers had been given before the effective date of a 1969 tax reform 
3148,law that greatly reduced the amount allowed as a tax deduction for 
3149,"such gifts. After considerable public interest and speculation, President "
3150,Nixon made public in December his tax returns for the four previous 
3151,"years, along with supporting financial data and a request that the "
3152,Congressional Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation deter- 
3153,mine whether he owed additional taxes. Both the Joint Committee 
3154,and the Internal Revenue Service investigated the matter. 
3155,"Late in March 1974, IRS notified the Special Prosecutor that its "
3156,inquiry had reached an impasse because of conflicts in the statements 
3157,"of those principally involved in the matter, and suggested that WSPF "
3158,conduct a grand jury investigation. While the IRS inquiry indicated 
3159,possible violations of law by former White House staff members 
3160,"whose activities were clearly within the terms of WSPF’s jurisdiction, "
3161,it also indicated the possible involvement of others who were not 
3162,covered b}^ the language in WSPF’s charter. To avoid any possible 
3163,"ambiguity, Jaworski requested and received from Attorney General "
3164,Saxbe specific authorization to conduct the entire investigation. 
3165,For about 7 months WSPF conducted an investigation to determine 
3166,70
3167,the facts concerning the alleged gift and whether efforts had been 
3168,"made to conceal the circumstances of the transaction. To this end, "
3169,the prosecutors interviewed and called before the grand jury a number 
3170,"of witnesses, including former White House staff members and officials "
3171,of the General Services Administration and its National Archives and 
3172,Records Service. They also received assistance from others who had 
3173,"looked into some of the questions, including the IRS, the Joint "
3174,"Committee, and the House Judiciary Committee. "
3175,The WSPF investigation resulted in the filing of charges against 
3176,three people. Former White House deputy counsel Edward L. Morgan 
3177,"pleaded guilty on November 8, 1974, to conspiring to defraud the "
3178,United States by participating in the preparation of backdated 
3179,"documents. He was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment, all but 4 "
3180,"months of which was suspended. On February 19, 1975, the grand "
3181,"jury filed a four-count indictment charging Frank DeMarco, a Los "
3182,"Angeles lawyer who had helped prepare President Nixon’s tax returns, "
3183,"and Ralph G. Newman, a Chicago book dealer and appraiser who "
3184,"had estimated the value of his papers for tax purposes, with having "
3185,engaged along with Morgan in a conspiracy to defraud the United 
3186,States. The indictment also charged DeMarco with making false 
3187,statements to IRS agents and with obstructing the Joint Committee’s 
3188,"inquiry, and Newman with assisting in the preparation of a false "
3189,"document filed with a tax return. After extensive legal argument, "
3190,including an unsuccessful mandamus petition by WSPF to the Court 
3191,"of Appeals, the defendants obtained separate trial settings, DeMarco "
3192,in Los Angeles and Newman in Chicago. As of the writing of this 
3193,"Report, the Los Angeles trial was scheduled for September 16 and "
3194,"the Chicago trial for October 28, 1975. "
3195,CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS 
3196,Investigations of 1972 Campaign Financing and Related Matters 
3197,"Beginning in June 1973, the Campaign Contributions task force "
3198,systematically examined the campaign finances of major 1972 Re- 
3199,publican and Democratic Presidential candidates. This examination 
3200,"included the investigation of several hundred separate transactions, "
3201,"including corporate and labor union contributions, recipients’ non- "
3202,"reporting of contributions and expenditures, and alleged quid pro quo "
3203,relationships between contributions and Government actions. 
3204,The task force began its inquiries on the basis of the following 
3205,major sources of information: 
3206,1. A list of persons who had made large contributions to President 
3207,"Nixon’s reelection campaign before April 7, 1972 — the effective date "
3208,of a new campaign law which required that contributions be reported 
3209,"publicly. The existence of this list, which was kept by the President’s "
3210,71
3211,"secretary, was initially disclosed in a civil suit brought by Common "
3212,Cause against the Finance Committee to Re-Elect the President 
3213,(FCRP). WSPF later obtained the list from the White House. 
3214,2. Reports of pre-April 7 contributions to several Democratic 
3215,"candidates, which the candidates had made public. "
3216,3. Reports of post-April 7 contributions to candidates of both 
3217,parties which had been filed with the General Accounting Office 
3218,pursuant to the new law. 
3219,4. Referrals from the Internal Revenue Service. 
3220,5. Information obtained in the Watergate investigation about 
3221,the sources and disposition of campaign funds used in the Watergate 
3222,break-in and cover-up. 
3223,"6. Newspaper articles, letters from citizens (many of them anony- "
3224,"mous), and similar sources. "
3225,A variety of investigative methods were used. The prosecutors 
3226,"interviewed major Republican and Democratic fundraisers, including "
3227,"Herbert Kalmbach of FCRP, who cooperated with the office under an "
3228,agreement involving his guilty plea to two charges (described else- 
3229,where in this section). Agents of the FBI and IRS examined the cam- 
3230,paign financial records of the major Presidential candidates and those 
3231,"Congressional candidates whose campaign finances, for various "
3232,"reasons, became relevant to matters directly within the jurisdiction "
3233,of the Special Prosecutor. The prosecutors sent letters to about 50 
3234,known contributors asking them to telephone the office and answer 
3235,certain questions. Many contributors were interviewed in person in 
3236,WSPF’s offices. FBI agents interviewed hundreds of employees and 
3237,financial officers of corporations and unions and examined bank and 
3238,corporate records; IRS agents took similar steps in cases that seemed 
3239,"to involve possible tax violations. In some cases, particularly when "
3240,there was a suspicion of an explicit quid pro quo relationship between 
3241,"contributions and Government actions, WSPF attorneys conducted "
3242,"interviews of contributors, fundraisers, and Government officials. "
3243,"Witnesses were also called before the grand jury, especially when it "
3244,appeared that attempts were being made to obstruct an investigation . 
3245,An important source of information in these inquiries was the dis- 
3246,closure by a number of corporations of their own illegal contributions. 
3247,"On July 6, 1973, American Airlines’ board chairman told WSPF and "
3248,publicly announced that the corporation had made an illegal contribu- 
3249,tion of corporate funds to the President’s re-election campaign. Special 
3250,Prosecutor Cox then issued a public invitation to other corporate 
3251,"executives to make similar disclosures, promising that: "
3252,[W]hen corporate officers come forward voluntarily and earty to 
3253,disclose illegal political contributions to candidates of either 
3254,"party, their voluntary acknowledgement will be considered as a "
3255,mitigating circumstance in deciding what charges to bring. 
3256,72
3257,Several corporations responded to this invitation shortly after it 
3258,"was issued, and others made similar disclosures in the ensuing months "
3259,(in some cases after learning that they were under investigation). The 
3260,corporations were required to disclose all corporate contributions to 
3261,candidates for Federal office within the period of the then statute of 
3262,limitations (1968-1973). The corporations were also required to dis- 
3263,close the basic method they had used to generate the contributed 
3264,"funds, including accumulations of cash in political “slush funds,” "
3265,"usually from overseas sources, and the use of bonus payments and "
3266,expense accounts to reimburse employees for contributions made in 
3267,their own names. Interviews were conducted to determine those cor- 
3268,"porate officers who were aware of, or authorized, the contribution and "
3269,also to learn what matters the corporation had pending before Federal 
3270,Government agencies. The prosecutors also investigated the possi- 
3271,bility of pressure on employees to donate to corporate “good Govern- 
3272,ment funds’ 7 which could be used to make otherwise legal political 
3273,contributions. In addition to the criminal charges WSPF brought 
3274,"against such corporate “volunteers,” other agencies such as IRS and "
3275,the Securities and Exchange Commission conducted investigations 
3276,and took action as a result of these disclosures to WSPF. 
3277,"On October 17, 1973, Cox announced an office policy on bringing "
3278,charges against corporate officers who had made voluntary disclosure 
3279,of corporate contributions: the corporation would be charged with 
3280,"violating Section 610 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, which prohibits "
3281,"corporate contributions, and the primarily responsible corporate "
3282,officer would be charged under the same statute with consenting to 
3283,the making of such a contribution. The officer’s cooperation in bringing 
3284,the violation to WSPF’s attention would be reflected in a one-count 
3285,"misdemeanor charge of “non-willful” consent, as distinct from the "
3286,"felony of “willful” consent, and in a decision not to charge other "
3287,officers or include additional counts. Variations of this pattern would 
3288,"be based on unusual degrees of cooperation, on obstructive conduct, "
3289,or on other unique circumstances. The corporations which made 
3290,voluntary full disclosure of illegal contributions at a point when little 
3291,or no investigative work had been done regarding their activities 
3292,were charged and sentenced as follows : 
3293,"— On October 17, 1973, American Airlines pleaded guilty to a "
3294,"one-count violation of Section 610 and received a fine of $5,000. "
3295,The board chairman was not charged because he had been the first 
3296,"corporate officer to make such a disclosure, and had done so before "
3297,Cox had issued his invitation. 
3298,"— On the same date, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company pleaded "
3299,"guilty to one count of violating Section 610 and was fined $5,000; "
3300,"the Chairman of Goodyear, Russell DeYoung, pleaded guilty to a "
3301,"one-count misdemeanor, Section 610 violation, and was fined $1,000. "
3302,73
3303,"— On the same date, Minnesota Mining and. Manufacturing Com- "
3304,pany pleaded guilty to a one-count Section 610 violation and was 
3305,"fined $3,000; the company’s chairman, Harry Heltzer, pleaded guilty "
3306,to a one-count misdemeanor of violating Section 610 and received a 
3307,$500 fine. 
3308,"— On November 12, 1973, Braniff Airways Inc., pleaded guilty to "
3309,"one count of violating Section 610 and was fined $5,000; Braniff’s "
3310,"chairman, Harding L. Lawrence, pleaded guilty to a one-count "
3311,"misdemeanor, Section 610 charge, and was fined $1,000. "
3312,"— On November 13, 1973, Ashland Petroleum Gabon Corp., a "
3313,"subsidiary of Ashland Oil, Inc., pleaded guilty to a one-count Section "
3314,"610 violation and was fined $5,000. Because his disclosure had closely "
3315,"followed American Airlines, Ashland’s chairman, Orin E. Atkins, "
3316,"was allowed to plead nolo contendere to a one-count Section 610, "
3317,"misdemeanor charge and was fined $1,000 "
3318,"— On the same date, Gulf Oil Corporation pleaded guilty to one "
3319,"count of violating Section 610 and received a $5,000 fine; Claude C. "
3320,"Wild, Jr., a vice-president of Gulf, pleaded guilty to a one-count "
3321,"misdemeanor under Section 610 and was fined $1,000. "
3322,"— On December 4, 1973, Phillips Petroleum Company pleaded "
3323,"guilty to one count of violating Section 610 and was fined $5,000; "
3324,chairman William W. Keeler pleaded guilty to a one-count mis- 
3325,"demeanor, Section 610 violation and received a $1,000 fine. "
3326,"— On December 19, 1973, Carnation Company pleaded guilty "
3327,"to a one-count Section 610 violation and was fined $5,000; its chairman, "
3328,"H. Everett Olson, pleaded guilty to a one-count misdemeanor viola- "
3329,"tion of Section 610 and received a $1,000 fine. "
3330,"— On March 7, 1974, Diamond International Corporation pleaded "
3331,"guilty to a one-count violation of Section 610 and received a $5,000 "
3332,"fine; Ray Dubrowin, the corporation’s vice president, pleaded guilty "
3333,"to a one-count misdemeanor under Section 610 and was fined $1,000. "
3334,"— On June 27, 1974, National By-Products, Inc., pleaded guilty "
3335,"to one count of violating Section 610 and was fined $1,000. The "
3336,responsible officer was not charged because the contribution had been 
3337,"very small, his disclosure had been motivated entirely by conscience, "
3338,"and under the circumstances of the contribution, success in an investi- "
3339,gation here had been highly unlikely. 
3340,"— On October 8, 1974, Greyhound Corporation pleaded guilty "
3341,"to a one-count, Section 610 violation and was fined $5,000. No corporate "
3342,officer was charged because there was substantial evidence that those 
3343,involved had believed their conduct to be legal and had relied on the 
3344,advice of counsel to that effect. 
3345,"— On December 30, 1974, Charles N. Huseman, of HMS Electric "
3346,"Corporation, pleaded guilty to a one-count violation of Section 610 "
3347,"as a misdemeanor and was fined $1,000. The corporation was not "
3348,74
3349,charged because it had been acquired by another corporation and 
3350,dissolved after the violation. 
3351,"— On January 28, 1975, Ratrie, Robbins, and Schweitzer, Inc. "
3352,pleaded guilty to a one-count Section 610 violation and was fined 
3353,"$2,500. Harry Ratrie and Augustus Robbins, III, each pleaded guilty "
3354,"to a one-count, Section 610 misdemeanor and received a suspended "
3355,sentence. Two officers were charged because they appeared to be 
3356,equally culpable. 
3357,"As the work of the task force progressed, it became clear that there "
3358,were different degrees of voluntary cooperation. The early volunteers 
3359,were aware that they might face investigation because their names or the 
3360,names of their corporations appeared on campaign records WSPF 
3361,"had obtained. Rather than constructing “cover stories, ” they decided "
3362,to acknowledge their conduct. Some other “volunteers” did not have 
3363,to guess that their contributions might be under investigation. WSPF 
3364,had already begun active inquiries when they decided to make their 
3365,disclosures. These belated “volunteers” were charged and sentenced 
3366,as follows : 
3367,"— On May 1, 1974, Northrop Corporation pleaded guilty to a "
3368,"one-count violation of Section 611 of Title 18, which prohibits cam- "
3369,"paign contributions by Government contractors, and was fined "
3370,"$5,000. Northrop was charged under this statute because a large "
3371,percentage of its total business was under Government contract. 
3372,"Northrop’s chairman, Thomas V. Jones, pleaded guilty to a charge "
3373,of willfully aiding and abetting in the illegal contribution and was 
3374,"fined $5,000. James Allen pleaded guilty to a one-count misdemeanor "
3375,"under Section 610 and received a $1,000 fine. Two officers were "
3376,"charged, one of them with a felony, because of obstructive conduct "
3377,in the course of the investigation. 
3378,"—On May 6, 1974, Lehigh Valley Cooperative Farmers pleaded "
3379,"guilty to one count of violating Section 610 and was fined $5,000. "
3380,"The Cooperative’s president, Richard L. Allison, pleaded guilty "
3381,"on May 17 to a one-count, Section 610 misdemeanor and received "
3382,"a $1,000 fine which was suspended, and Francis X. Carroll pleaded "
3383,guilty May 28 to a misdemeanor charge of aiding and abetting a 
3384,"violation of Section 610, receiving a suspended sentence. Two persons "
3385,were charged in this matter because of relatively minor obstructive 
3386,conduct. 
3387,"— On September 17, 1974, LBC & W, Inc., pleaded guilty to a "
3388,"one-count violation of Section 611 and received a $5,000 fine; a "
3389,substantial portion of the firm’s total business was under Government 
3390,"contract. William Lyles, Sr., pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor "
3391,"counts of violating Section 610 and was fined $2,000. "
3392,"— On October 23, 1974, Time Oil Corporation pleaded guilty "
3393,"to two counts of violating Section 610 and was fined $5,000; its "
3394,"president, Raymond Abendroth, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor "
3395,"Section 610 counts and was fined $2,000. "
3396,"— On December 20, 1974, Ashland Oil, Inc. pleaded guilty to "
3397,"five counts of violating Section 610 and was fined $25,000. This "
3398,second prosecution of Ashland resulted from its failure to make full 
3399,disclosure during the initial investigation. No corporate officer 
3400,was charged because the officers were not the persons primarily 
3401,responsible for withholding the information. 
3402,Some alleged corporate donors were prosecuted solely as a result 
3403,of investigations with no voluntary disclosures. A referral from the 
3404,"IRS resulted on October 19, 1973, in the charging of Dwayne Andreas "
3405,and the First Interoceanic Corporation with four counts of violating 
3406,Section 610. They were acquitted by a judge in Federal court in 
3407,"Minnesota on July 12, 1974. "
3408,An investigation into the contribution activity of American Ship 
3409,"Building Company resulted in the indictment on April 5, 1974, of the "
3410,"corporation and its chairman, George M. Steinbrenner, III, on a charge "
3411,of conspiring to make corporate contributions to several candidates 
3412,"and campaign organizations. In addition, the corporation was charged "
3413,"with one count of violating Section 610, and Steinbrenner was charged "
3414,"with five felony counts of violating Section 610, two counts of aiding "
3415,"and abetting the making of false statements to criminal investigators, "
3416,four counts of obstructing justice and two counts of obstructing a 
3417,"criminal investigation. John H. Melcher, Jr., another officer of the "
3418,"corporation, pleaded guilty April 18, 1974, to a charge of being an "
3419,accessory after the fact to a corporate contribution and was fined 
3420,"$2,500. After plea negotiations with WSPF, American Ship Building "
3421,pleaded guilty on August 23 to the charges against it and was fined 
3422,"$20,000. On the same date, Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to the felony "
3423,conspiracy charge and to a charge of being an accessory after the fact 
3424,"to a corporate contribution, receiving a fine of $15,000. The remaining "
3425,charges against Steinbrenner were dropped following his plea of guilty. 
3426,The investigation into the sources of campaign funds which came 
3427,to be used in the Watergate cover-up resulted in a guilty plea of 
3428,"Tim M. Babcock, an executive of Occidental Petroleum Corp. and "
3429,"former Governor of Montana, on a charge of making a campaign "
3430,"contribution in another person's name, on December 10, 1974. He "
3431,"was sentenced to a year in prison, with all but 4 months suspended, "
3432,"and a $1,000 fine. His sentence is now on appeal on the question of "
3433,whether the particular sentencing provision applied here legally 
3434,permits imprisonment. 
3435,The investigations into corporate and union contributions and 
3436,other illegal activities by donors of campaign funds resulted in no 
3437,additional prosecutions as of September 1975 (although a few matters 
3438,are still open). A few other corporations were found to have made 
3439,relatively small contributions of corporate funds and were not pros- 
3440,76
3441,ecuted because of the small amounts involved and for other reasons 
3442,detailed in Chapter 2. The prosecutors reviewed all contributions 
3443,identified with unions or their officers in search of patterns that might 
3444,"indicate a union source for individual contributions, but found only "
3445,one suspicious pattern; the investigation did not develop sufficient 
3446,evidence to bring charges. 
3447,The task force also looked into possible illegal conduct of people 
3448,and organizations receiving campaign funds on behalf of candidates. 
3449,The investigation of American Ship Building Company’s contributions 
3450,"resulted in a plea of guilty by “DKI for 74,” a committee supporting "
3451,"the re-election of Senator Daniel Inouye, to a charge of failing to "
3452,report a contribution. The sentence was suspended. The investigation 
3453,and eventual disclosure of a contribution of Time Oil Corporation 
3454,"resulted in a plea of guilty on June 11, 1975, by former Representative "
3455,"Wendell Wyatt, who had headed the Oregon Committee to Re- "
3456,"Elect the President, to a charge of failing to report a campaign "
3457,expenditure. He was fined $750. 
3458,The investigation of the activities of the Finance Committee to 
3459,Re-Elect the President resulted in a plea of guilty by its former 
3460,"chairman, Maurice Stans, who had served as Secretary of Commerce "
3461,"in the Nixon Administration, to three counts of failure to report "
3462,contributions and expenditures of the Committee and two counts of 
3463,"accepting corporate contributions, all misdemeanors. Stans was fined "
3464,"$5,000. No criminal charges were brought against other FCRP officials "
3465,or fundraisers for other 1972 candidates. 
3466,The task force also investigated over 30 allegations of improper 
3467,influence on Government actions by contributors to the President’s 
3468,"1972 campaign, including Justice Department actions in antitrust "
3469,"matters, Environmental Protection Agency decisions in enforce- "
3470,"ment proceedings, Price Commission and Cost of Living Council "
3471,"rulings, the awarding of bank charters, decisions on airline routes "
3472,"and mergers, decisions on product safety standards, the exercise of "
3473,"the President’s clemency power, the handling of a criminal prosecu- "
3474,"tion, decisions on oil import allocations, and a decision to raise milk "
3475,price supports (discussed elsewhere in this section). None of these 
3476,inquiries developed sufficient evidence to support criminal charges. 
3477,Other allegations involving Democratic campaign financing 
3478,"were investigated, including a charge that the Democratic National "
3479,Committee had received corporate contributions in the form of dis- 
3480,counts in the settlement of its 1968 campaign debt. These inquiries 
3481,did not produce sufficient evidence to support criminal charges. An 
3482,investigation into the failure of the Democratic National Com- 
3483,mittee to report correctly a large contribution resulted in no charges 
3484,"because the statute of limitations, as amended retroactively in 1974, "
3485,barred prosecution.

3488,Investigation Info Alleged Sales ol Ambassadorships 
3489,Information obtained from major campaign contributors and 
3490,"fundraisers in early summer 1973, and a document obtained from "
3491,"the White House, suggested that officials of the White House and the "
3492,Finance Committee to Re-Elect the President (FCRP) might have 
3493,promised ambassadorial appointments in return for large campaign 
3494,contributions. A full-scale inquiry into the alleged sales of ambas- 
3495,sadorships commenced in the autumn of 1973. 
3496,The investigation centered on possible promises to certain indi- 
3497,viduals who had made large contributions to President Nixon's 
3498,re-election. Because the prosecutors felt that favor-selling public 
3499,officials would be more culpable by reason of their public trust than 
3500,"favor-seeking contributors, if such illegal conduct had occurred, the "
3501,investigation initially focused on obtaining the testimony of the 
3502,"contributors. However, the first admission that an ambassadorship "
3503,had been promised in return for a campaign contribution came from 
3504,"fundraiser Herbert Kalmbach, who pleaded guilty on February 24, "
3505,"1974, to a charge of promising employment as a reward for political "
3506,"activity. Kalmbach, who pleaded guilty to another charge (described "
3507,"elsewhere in this section) at the same time, was sentenced to 6-months "
3508,imprisonment. 
3509,"On March 14, 1974, the grand jury subpoenaed White House "
3510,documents relating to the possible appointments and contributions 
3511,"of four persons, and the White House supplied a number of documents "
3512,which provided additional evidence. Some of the contributors even- 
3513,"tually cooperated with the office and furnished information, as did "
3514,former FCRP chairman Maurice Stans in connection with his guilty 
3515,plea to other charges (described elsewhere in this section). The 
3516,"contributors, former White House officials, and campaign fundraisers "
3517,were questioned before the grand jury. Although contributors of 
3518,large campaign sums obviously received Administration responses to 
3519,"their desires to serve as ambassadors, a crime is not proved unless "
3520,"the prosecution can show a prior quid pro quo arrangement, i.e., a prior "
3521,commitment of support for the position in exchange for a forthcoming 
3522,contribution. Such proof is available only if one of the participants 
3523,"in such a conversation admits the express commitment. However, "
3524,each official and fundraiser involved denied having made promises 
3525,of appointments and WSPF was unable to prove the contrary. Al- 
3526,though one matter was still under investigation as this Report was 
3527,"written, the evidence in other matters was insufficient to support any "
3528,additional criminal charges. 
3529,"""Townhouse"" Investigation "
3530,"Between 1970 and 1972, press accounts indicated that the White "
3531,House had sponsored a secret program for raising and disbursing funds 
3532,78
3533,for selected Republican candidates in the 1970 Congressional elections. 
3534,This program operated from a Washington townhouse and ultimately 
3535,became known as “Townhouse.” The operation was not thought to 
3536,"be a matter within WSPF’s jurisdiction until August 1973, when a "
3537,separate investigation brought to light more details about the manner 
3538,"in which it had been conducted. During the early fall of 1973, Attorney "
3539,General Richardson informally referred the “Townhouse” investiga- 
3540,"tion to WSPF, and the referral was formalized by Acting Attorney "
3541,General Bork in January 1974. 
3542,"The “Townhouse” inquiry began with interviews of Jack Gleason, "
3543,a former White House aide who had played a principal role in the 
3544,"project. He supplied records showing that over $3,000,000 had been "
3545,received and disbursed during the operation. Subsequent investiga- 
3546,tion revealed these details: fundraiser Herbert Kalmbach had 
3547,"obtained pledges of large amounts from various contributors, informing "
3548,them that Gleason would contact them about payment; Gleason 
3549,"then instructed the contributors to send their checks to him, and he "
3550,forwarded the funds to particular campaigns as instructed by members 
3551,of the White House staff; he reported principally to White House 
3552,"aide Harry Dent who, in turn, reported to other White House officials. "
3553,"After research into the legality of the operation, the prosecutors "
3554,concluded that those involved had constituted a political committee 
3555,which had unlawfully failed to elect officers and file financial reports. 
3556,"Their failure to do so, the secrecy with which they conducted their "
3557,"operations, and the large amounts of money involved led the prose- "
3558,cutors to initiate a grand jury investigation in the fall of 1973. In 
3559,"connection with the grand jury’s inquiry, the prosecutors asked the "
3560,White House to supply additional “Townhouse” records which had 
3561,been transferred to White House files. The records were not produced 
3562,until March 1974. 
3563,"Kalmbach, who was cooperating with WSPF in a number of "
3564,"its investigations, pleaded guilty on February 25, 1974, to a felony "
3565,"violation of the Corrupt Practices Act. Thereafter, he furnished "
3566,additional documents from his files regarding the “Townhouse” 
3567,project and provided further information during office interviews 
3568,and grand jury appearances. 
3569,"On November 15 and December 11, 1974, respectively, Gleason "
3570,and Dent pleaded guilty to misdemeanor violations of the Corrupt 
3571,Practices Act. Both received sentences of 1 month’s probation. 
3572,The prosecutors also looked into the possible criminal liability 
3573,"of others involved in the 1970 “Townhouse” project, but brought "
3574,no further charges against them. 
3575,79
3576,Milk Fund Investigation 
3577,"In late Jufy 1973, WSPF’s campaign contributions task force "
3578,began investigating possible illegal activities involving Associated 
3579,"Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI), the Nation’s largest organization of "
3580,dairy farmers. The office’s interest in the matter resulted from press 
3581,reports and the filing of a civil suit by Ralph Nader alleging that a 
3582,1971 Administration decision to raise milk price supports had been 
3583,influenced by an AMPI commitment of substantial funds to President 
3584,Nixon’s 1972 campaign. 
3585,The attorneys assigned to this investigation functioned for most 
3586,purposes as a separate task force within the office. They began by 
3587,"interviewing AMPI’s general manager and other employees, and "
3588,"examining evidence obtained in the Nader suit. Then, having learned "
3589,from a former AMPI employee of a series of diversions of AMPI 
3590,funds which evidently had been contributed illegally to various politi- 
3591,"cal candidates, they obtained grand jury testimony by AMPI officials "
3592,"Bob Lilly and Robert Isham who, under immunity, provided infor- "
3593,mation concerning four areas of possible criminal conduct by persons 
3594,associated with AMPI. 
3595,The first of these areas was the allegation that AMPI had con- 
3596,"cealed a 1969 contribution of $100,000 to President Nixon’s 1972 "
3597,campaign by using a “dummy” to deliver the funds. Investigation of 
3598,the 1969 payment resulted in charges against AMPI and Harold 
3599,"Nelson, its former general manager. Nelson’s plea of guilty, described "
3600,"more fully below, included admissions that he had made the payment "
3601,in order to gain “access” to the White House for AMPI and that he 
3602,had attempted to conceal the ultimate source of the contribution. 
3603,"On the basis of information they had received, the prosecutors "
3604,also investigated other political contributions b}^ AMPI. The investi- 
3605,"gation uncovered evidence of numerous contributions, usually made "
3606,"through conduits to hide the true source of the money. For example, "
3607,"it appeared that AMPI employees, attorneys, or consultants had made "
3608,"contributions in their own names and then, by prior agreement, had "
3609,been reimbursed by AMPI in the form of “bonuses” or fees. AMPI also 
3610,disguised political contributions by using corporate funds to pay for 
3611,"services provided to candidates by third parties, and assigning its em- "
3612,ployees to work in favored campaigns while continuing to be paid by 
3613,AMPI. The evidence gathered in this part of the investigation led to 
3614,a number of criminal dispositions: 
3615,"—On July 24, 1974, David Parr, formerly special counsel to AMPI, "
3616,pleaded guilty to a felony conspiracy to make corporate contributions. 
3617,"In acknowledging his guilt, he admitted his role in causing AMPI to "
3618,"contribute a total of $220,000 to eight different candidates in 1968, "
3619,"1970, and 1972. Parr was fined $10,000 and sentenced to 2-years im- "
3620,prisonment. All but 4 months of the prison term were suspended. 
3621,80
3622,— AMPI’s former general manager Nelson pleaded guilty on July 
3623,"31, 1974, to felony charges of conspiracy to make corporate contribu- "
3624,tions and making an illegal payment to a public official. He admitted 
3625,"that he had caused AMPI to make contributions totaling $330,000 to "
3626,"seven different campaign funds in 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1972, and had "
3627,"approved a payment to another party in 1971, allegedly for the "
3628,"benefit of John Connally, Secretary of the Treasury. Nelson was sen- "
3629,"tenced to pay a $10,000 fine and serve a 2-year prison term, with all "
3630,but 4 months suspended. 
3631,"— On August 1, 1974, AMPI pleaded guilty to conspiracy to make "
3632,"corporate campaign contributions, and the making of five such contri- "
3633,"butions totalling $280,000, and was fined the $35,000 maximum. "
3634,"— Norman Sherman and John Valentine, who had operated a com- "
3635,"puter service and had received $84,000 from AMPI for services pro- "
3636,"vided to several candidates, each pleaded guilty on August 12, 1974, "
3637,to misdemeanor charges of aiding and abetting illegal corporate con- 
3638,tributions. Each was fined $500. 
3639,"— Jack Chestnut, the manager of Hubert Humphrey’s 1970 Senate "
3640,"campaign in Minnesota, was indicted on December 23, 1974, for felo- "
3641,niously aiding and abetting a corporate contribution by arranging for 
3642,AMPI to pay for the services of a New York advertising firm to the 
3643,"Humphrey campaign. At WSPF’s request after the indictment, "
3644,Chestnut’s trial was conducted in May 1975 by the U.S. Attorney’s 
3645,"office for the Southern District of New York, and resulted in his con- "
3646,viction and a 4-month prison sentence. The conviction is now on 
3647,appeal. 
3648,"— On December 19, 1974, Stuart Russell, an Oklahoma City "
3649,"attorney retained by AMPI, was indicted for conspiracy and two "
3650,counts of aiding and abetting the making of corporate contributions. 
3651,The charges were based on evidence of his major role as a conduit for 
3652,political contributions of AMPI funds. He was convicted in July 1975 
3653,"on all three felony counts after a trial in San Antonio, Texas, and "
3654,received a 2-year prison sentence. His appeal is pending. 
3655,The third area of investigation involving AMPI concerned events 
3656,surrounding the Administration’s 1971 decision to raise milk price 
3657,"supports and AMPI’s commitment of funds for the 1972 campaign, "
3658,"but despite an extensive probe, the prosecutors were unable to obtain "
3659,sufficient evidence to recommend criminal charges against anyone. 
3660,The final area of the investigation of AMPI’s activities concerned 
3661,the allegation that former Treasury Secretary Connally had accepted 
3662,illegal payments from AMPI following the Administration’s 1971 
3663,decision to increase milk price support levels. This investigation 
3664,"resulted in the charge against Nelson, described above, to which he "
3665,"pleaded guilty. In addition, Jake Jacobsen, a Texas attorney formerly "
3666,"retained by AMPI, was charged on February 21, 1974, with having "
3667,made false declarations before the grand jury. This charge was dis- 
3668,81
3669,"missed as technically defective on May 3, but Jacobsen was indicted "
3670,"again on July 29, 1974, for making an illegal payment to a public "
3671,official. He pleaded guilty on August 7 and is awaiting sentence. 
3672,Connally was also named as a defendant with Jacobsen in the July 29 
3673,indictment. He was charged with receiving illegal payments on two 
3674,"occasions while he was Secretary of the Treasury, conspiring with "
3675,Jacobsen to commit perjury and obstruct justice in connection with 
3676,"investigations of those payments, and making false declarations to "
3677,"the grand jury. Prior to trial, the court ruled that the charges of "
3678,accepting illegal payments should be tried first and separately. 
3679,Connally was tried on these charges and found not guilty by a jury 
3680,"on April 17, 1975. Because the jury had also heard all the evidence the "
3681,prosecutors possessed for any future trial on the other charges against 
3682,"Connally, those charges were dismissed on April 18. "
3683,Hughes-Rebozo Investigation 
3684,"In October 1973, WSPF began receiving from the Internal Revenue "
3685,Service the preliminary results of its investigation into an unreported 
3686,"cash contribution of $100,000 by industrialist Howard R. Hughes "
3687,"delivered by a Hughes representative to Charles G. Rebozo, a close "
3688,friend of President Nixon. The funds had been delivered in two equal 
3689,"installments in 1970, but according to Rebozo's public explanation, "
3690,the identical cash had been returned to Hughes in June 1973. 
3691,"Since July 1973, the Senate Select Committee had also been con- "
3692,ducting an investigation which was essentially parallel to that of the 
3693,"IRS. In December 1973 and thereafter, the Committee questioned "
3694,numerous witnesses in Executive Session about the Hughes contribu- 
3695,"tion. In late March one witness, Herbert W. Kalmbach, formerly the "
3696,"personal attorney for Richard Nixon, alleged that on April 30, 1973, "
3697,Rebozo had told him of having disbursed some of the Hughes money 
3698,"to a friend and family members of the President, and others. Investi- "
3699,gators also searched to see whether the Hughes cash that had been 
3700,returned by Rebozo in 1973 bore serial numbers that indicated the 
3701,cash had been in public circulation at the time of the alleged deliveries 
3702,by Hughes' representative to Rebozo in 1970. 
3703,"On the basis of Senate and IRS information, the Special Prose- "
3704,cutor's office launched a wider investigation. Although the charter of 
3705,the Special Prosecutor's office included authority to investigate all 
3706,"matters arising out of the 1972 Presidential election campaign, for "
3707,"which, according to Rebozo, the Hughes contribution had been "
3708,"intended, it was determined that there should be some clarification of "
3709,WSPF's jurisdiction to investigate the matter. By letter dated 
3710,"April 15, 1974, the Attorney General specifically assigned to the Special "
3711,Prosecutor the responsibility for conducting an investigation into the 
3712,"Hughes contribution and related matters. At about the same time, "
3713,82
3714,the Internal Revenue Service referred its investigation to the Special 
3715,Prosecutor along with an interim report recommending a grand jury 
3716,inquiry to resolve conflicts in the testimony of witnesses about the 
3717,"delivery and purpose of the Hughes money, as well as its possible use, "
3718,and to seek evidence of other such secret contributions. 
3719,Three broad categories of inquiry were pursued: any possible 
3720,"bribery and campaign contribution violations, any income tax viola- "
3721,"tions, and any perjury or false statements arising from prior testimony. "
3722,A grand jury investigation was begun in late April 1974 with the 
3723,issuance of numerous subpoenas for documents. 
3724,"The Senate investigation also continued and in May 1974, a former "
3725,"aide to H. R. Haldeman, Lawrence M. Higby, testified before the "
3726,Committee that Haldeman had described to him an offer which the 
3727,"President had made to pay $400,000 from funds under Rebozo's "
3728,"control, for Haldeman's anticipated legal fees. "
3729,"The Select Committee's investigation ended in July 1974, when the "
3730,Committee published a lengthy staff report describing the information 
3731,disclosed during its investigation. The report included allegations: 
3732,"(1) that in June 1972 Rebozo had used funds, which were left from "
3733,"the 1968 campaign and kept in one of his bank accounts, to pay for "
3734,diamond earrings for Mrs. Nixon; and (2) that Rebozo had paid for a 
3735,swimming pool and related improvements to the President's Key 
3736,"Biscayne residences with about $25,000 cash from unknown sources "
3737,in 1972. 
3738,"During May and June 1974, the Special Prosecutor's office obtained "
3739,all documents from the files of the Senate Select Committee and the 
3740,Internal Revenue Service relating to Rebozo's finances. On the basis 
3741,"of these materials, the grand jury inquiry was broadened and nearly "
3742,200 subpoenas for documents were issued between April 1974 and 
3743,"July 1975. In addition, 28 witnesses testified before the grand jury, "
3744,75 persons were questioned by the Special Prosecutor's office and 47 
3745,persons were interviewed in the field by a team of specially detailed 
3746,"agents of the Internal Revenue Service. In all, 123 different persons "
3747,"were questioned, many of them repeatedly. Included among those "
3748,"questioned were officials and employees of the White House, the "
3749,"Finance Committee to Re-elect the President, Hughes' Summa "
3750,"Corporation, the Key Biscayne Bank, and many others. "
3751,The IRS team also assisted the Special Prosecutor's office in 
3752,evaluating the voluminous financial records obtained. Between April 
3753,"and December 1974, the agents and Assistant Special Prosecutors "
3754,analyzed thousands of pages of records received from more than 240 
3755,sources. 
3756,Secondary sources of information also were systematically and 
3757,"exhaustively utilized. This included records from banks, accountants, "
3758,"attorneys, various business partners and associates, business firms, "
3759,"and so forth. Second, voluminous records were reviewed of telephone "
3760,83
3761,"calls, travel, meetings with Administration officials, and correspond- "
3762,"ence with various persons. Third, persons suspected of making secret "
3763,"contributions were questioned and their documents reviewed. Fourth, "
3764,tapes and hundreds of memoranda and other documents from the 
3765,White House files were studied for any references to relevant financial 
3766,transactions or any actions involving soliciting or use of funds for 
3767,President Nixon. 
3768,Extensive investigation was undertaken concerning the source and 
3769,application of all funds which required examination in order to resolve 
3770,the matters raised in the Senate Select Committee materials. Docu- 
3771,ments and information were obtained which had not been available 
3772,"to the Committee, and they helped resolve some questions which "
3773,were raised by the Senate report. 
3774,"Investigation was also pursued into the suggestion in an April 17, "
3775,"1973, Presidential tape that Rebozo maintained a secret fund of about "
3776,"$300,000. At the trial of the Watergate cover-up defendants, prose- "
3777,cutors used a transcript of this tape of a conversation among President 
3778,Nixon and his aides H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman. In the 
3779,"conversation, President Nixon offered to pay $200,000 to $300,000 "
3780,for their legal fees from funds to be provided by Rebozo. 
3781,"After all investigation was completed, and the evidence had been "
3782,evaluated by the prosecutors who ran the investigation and by the 
3783,"General Counsel’s office of the Internal Revenue Service, it was con- "
3784,cluded by the prosecutors that the evidence would not support an 
3785,indictment. 
3786,Notional Hispanic Finance Committee Investigation 
3787,Information provided by the Senate Select Committee indicated 
3788,"the possibility that former staff members of the White House, the "
3789,"Committee to Re-Elect the President, and the National Hispanic "
3790,Finance Committee (an arm of the Finance Committee to Re-Elect 
3791,the President) had tried to influence the Government’s grant-making 
3792,and contracting processes to obtain the support of members of the 
3793,Spanish-speaking community for the President’s reelection. Although 
3794,these allegations were similar to those related to the Administration’s 
3795,“ Responsiveness Program” (see discussion of “ Responsiveness Pro- 
3796,"gram”), they were investigated by personnel of a different task force "
3797,because they seemed to involve principally representatives of the 
3798,President’s campaign organization. 
3799,WSPF investigated several allegations of possible criminal conduct 
3800,including : 
3801,— That the award of Government contracts to a particular firm 
3802,had been curtailed because the firm’s president had declined to support 
3803,President Nixon’s re-election campaign; one means of this curtailment 
3804,had been the “graduation” of the firm beyond the eligibility require- 
3805,84
3806,ment for the Small Business Administration (SBA) program which 
3807,awards Government contracts to minority-owned firms outside the 
3808,normal bidding process. 
3809,"— That a builder who was having legal difficulties, in a housing "
3810,program for low-income families subsidized by the Federal Housing 
3811,"Administration, had been solicited for a $100,000 contribution in re- "
3812,turn for the clearing up of his legal problems. 
3813,— That a prominent Mexican-American citizen had been offered 
3814,a Federal judgeship in exchange for a campaign contribution. 
3815,"— That improper influence, possibly involving persons connected "
3816,"with the Hispanic Finance Committee, had existed in the awarding of "
3817,"grants, SBA loans, and Government contracts. "
3818,"These inquiries consumed about one year of an attorney’s time, but "
3819,did not produce sufficient evidence to support criminal charges. 
3820,OFFICE OF COUNSEL TO THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR 
3821,The office of counsel to the Special Prosecutor was organized to 
3822,"deal with numerous legal and policy issues, many of them novel, "
3823,that confronted the Special Prosecutor’s office. These issues required 
3824,counsel to function in four basic areas: giving legal advice to task 
3825,"forces, managing appeals and civil matters, advising the Special "
3826,"Prosecutor on legal and policy questions, and assisting in liaison "
3827,with other agencies. 
3828,Legal Advice to Task Forces . The counsel’s office gave each task 
3829,force advice on particular legal issues that arose during the course 
3830,"of investigations, helped design charges based on the facts developed "
3831,"and the applicable law, and provided legal assistance during trials. "
3832,In addition to providing the legal research needed to conduct investi- 
3833,"gations and prosecutions, the Counsel’s office insured that the task "
3834,forces would take consistent legal positions on common issues. 
3835,Management of Litigation. The counsel’s office supervised the prepa- 
3836,ration of and reviewed all pretrial and post-trial motions and appellate 
3837,briefs (also including appeals from the 1973 convictions of the 
3838,Watergate break-in defendants) in prosecutions and appeals stemming 
3839,from WSPF trials. Counsel also conducted some of the Special 
3840,"Prosecutor’s litigation. For example, the Counsel directed litigation "
3841,"over grand jury and trial subpoenas for Presidential tapes, the grand "
3842,jury report submitted to the House Judiciary Committee in connection 
3843,"with its impeachment inquiry, and access to White House tapes and "
3844,documents after President Nixon’s resignation. 
3845,Legal and Policy Advice to the Special Prosecutor. The Office of 
3846,Counsel regularly consulted with and advised the Special Prosecutor 
3847,"on legal issues requiring his decision. In this regard, counsel reviewed "
3848,each indictment before it was presented to the Special Prosecutor for 
3849,"his consideration and gave his recommendation as to which, if any, "
3850,charges should be brought in each proposed prosecution or other 
3851,"disposition of liability (such as a guilty plea). In each case, this in- "
3852,volved a review of the prosecution memorandum prepared by the 
3853,task force and an analysis of the facts developed in light of the applicable 
3854,law to determine the likelihood of successful prosecution. The Office 
3855,"also helped formulate standards for questioning witnesses, bringing "
3856,"criminal charges, and accepting guilty pleas. Finally, counsel directed "
3857,all research into the question of whether an incumbent President 
3858,could be indicted and into the validity of the pardon granted to 
3859,former President Nixon. 
3860,"From time to time, the Counsel's office was also consulted on legal "
3861,and policy issues not directly related to the prosecution function. 
3862,These included relationships with the White House and the issue of 
3863,"executive privilege generally, relationships with the Senate Select Com- "
3864,mittee and the House Judiciary Committee concerning the exchange 
3865,of information and the effect of their proceedings on the office's 
3866,prosecutions (particularly with regard to pre-trial publicity). The 
3867,Counsel's office also had a major role in WSPF’s review of pending 
3868,"legislation related to the Special Prosecutor's work, such as the Grand "
3869,"Jury Extension Act, proposed legislation to establish an independent "
3870,"special prosecutor, and proposed legislation concerning the scope of "
3871,the Special Prosecutor's final report. 
3872,Liaison With Other Agencies . — In addition to assistance in liaison 
3873,"with other agencies, including the White House counsel's office, divi- "
3874,"sions of the Department of Justice and Congressional staffs, Counsel's "
3875,office acted as liaison with bar associations seeking information for use 
3876,in bar disciplinary proceedings involving attorneys who had been 
3877,convicted or investigated by WSPF. 
3878,86
3879,Relations With Presidents 
3880,and White House Staffs 
3881,EFFORTS TO OBTAIN EVIDENCE 
3882,Early Requests for Documents 
3883,"During his confirmation hearings in May 1973, Attorney General- "
3884,designate Elliot Richardson expressed his belief that the Special 
3885,Prosecutor would gain access to Presidential papers without litigation. 
3886,He said: 
3887,"[F]rom all I have seen and from the President’s statements, he "
3888,intends that whatever should be made public in terms of the pub- 
3889,lic interest in these investigations should be disclosed. 
3890,"Nevertheless, at Cox’s insistence, in order to formalize and reinforce "
3891,"his independence to challenge any withholding of information, the "
3892,guidelines for his office granted the Special Prosecutor “full authority” 
3893,in “determining whether or not to contest the assertion of ‘Executive 
3894,Privilege.’ ” 
3895,"The first exchange of letters occurred on May 30, when Cox "
3896,wrote to White House counsel J. Fred Buzhardt to confirm an earlier 
3897,telephone request that all White House files related to the Special 
3898,Prosecutor’s investigation be kept “secure.” Buzhardt responded that 
3899,certain files had been placed under the protection of the FBI on 
3900,"April 30, but that the “handling, protection and disposition of "
3901,"Presidential Papers is, of course, a matter for the decision of the Presi- "
3902,"dent.” In the months that followed, the White House repeatedly "
3903,delayed their responses to the Special Prosecutor’s requests for docu- 
3904,ments by citing the need for a personal decision of the President. 
3905,"On June 6, Cox and Special Consultant James Vorenberg "
3906,"met with Buzhardt, White House counsel Leonard Garment, and "
3907,"Charles Alan Wright, a consultant to the White House counsel’s "
3908,office. At this meeting Wright stated his understanding that the doc- 
3909,trine of executive privilege gave the President an absolute right to 
3910,refuse to disclose in either judicial or congressional proceedings any 
3911,confidential communications between the President and his advisers 
3912,and any memoranda generated by White House staff members con- 
3913,cerning the constitutional duties of the President. 
3914,87
3915,The issue of executive privilege soon arose in a concrete context. 
3916,Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen refused to discuss with 
3917,the Special Prosecutor the exact content of conversations that he 
3918,"had had with the President, on the grounds that the conversations "
3919,were perhaps subject to attorney-client privilege. Cox requested that 
3920,Buzhardt determine whether the President would assert any “claim 
3921,of legal privilege or other confidential relationship” that would 
3922,prevent Petersen or former Attorney General Richard Kleindienst 
3923,from fully disclosing their relevant conversations with him. In addi- 
3924,"tion, Cox requested access to the tape recording of an April 15 con- "
3925,versation between the President and former White House counsel 
3926,John Dean; evidence indicated its prime relevance to the cover-up 
3927,investigation. In the next few days Cox also made requests for: 
3928,(a) an inventory of the files of 12 Nixon aides and Administration 
3929,officials; (b) all logs and diaries reflecting meetings and telephone 
3930,calls between the President and 15 specified individuals; and (c) a 
3931,letter explaining the administrative organization and procedures of 
3932,the White House and listing the names of staff members of key Nixon 
3933,aides. 
3934,Buzhardt responded with President Nixon's view that all of his 
3935,discussions with Petersen and Kleindienst were within “both executive 
3936,"privilege and the attorney-client privilege,” but said that the President "
3937,had decided to waive all applicable privileges as to these discussions. 
3938,With respect to the conversation between the President and Dean on 
3939,"April 15, Buzhardt stated that the President, when he had offered that "
3940,"tape to Petersen, had been referring only to the President's dictation "
3941,of his own recollections of the conversation. Buzhardt's response 
3942,"concluded that “it would, of course, not be appropriate to produce that "
3943,tape.” 
3944,"In responding to Buzhardt on June 20, Cox objected on two "
3945,grounds to the President's denial of the tape recording of his recol- 
3946,"lections: first, since the President had offered to allow Petersen to "
3947,"listen to the tape, there could be no proper reason for withholding "
3948,it from the Special Prosecutor who had assumed control of the Water- 
3949,"gate investigation; second, the conversation was “critically important” "
3950,to the task of untangling the complicated allegations about an at- 
3951,tempt to cover up responsibility for the Watergate break-in. As Cox 
3952,put it: 
3953,In this case the witness is the President. Whatever may be the 
3954,"power of the Judicial Branch to subpoena him, it is certainly "
3955,appropriate to obtain information from the President in ways less 
3956,likely to interfere with the performance of his high responsibilities; 
3957,and it is for this reason that I have thus far confined myself to a 
3958,request for his recorded recollection [and not made a request for 
3959,his personal testimony]. If the President wants the full facts 
3960,developed without fear or favor — as 1 assume must be the case — 
3961,then surely he must be willing for us to have such potentially 
3962,88
3963,important information without argument about any privilege he 
3964,might theoretically assert. 
3965,"During the next two weeks Cox also requested access to the “ITT"" "
3966,"file maintained by Fred Fielding, one of Mr. Dean's assistants. "
3967,By this time the White House had produced some documents in 
3968,"response to earlier requests. On June 22, WSPF received a list of "
3969,Petersen's and Attorney General John Mitchell's meetings and 
3970,"telephone calls with the President. A week later, another letter ex- "
3971,plained the White House staff organization and enclosed a list of 
3972,"the staff members of various key personnel. In addition, WSPF "
3973,"received a copy of the list kept by Hose Mary Woods, the President's "
3974,"secretary, of pre-April 7, 1972, cash contributors to the Nixon cam- "
3975,"paign. There was no response, however, to Cox's request for inventories "
3976,"of White House files related to Watergate, the Fielding ITT file, or "
3977,the President's taped recollections of his April 15 meeting with Dean. 
3978,Nor was there any response to Cox's request of June 27 that the 
3979,President provide a detailed written narrative responding to Dean's 
3980,Senate Select Committee testimony. 
3981,"Early in July, the office, in suggesting the need for delay in the "
3982,"Watergate civil suits, represented in court its intention to bring an "
3983,indictment in the Watergate case no later than September. Never- 
3984,"theless, a thorough investigation required access to additional White "
3985,"House files. On July 10, Cox wrote Buzhardt that “the delay [in "
3986,responding to our requests] is now hampering our investigation of 
3987,"possible criminal offenses by high Government officials."" Reminding "
3988,Buzhardt that he had been “very patient — perhaps too patient — in 
3989,"seeking voluntary cooperation,"" Cox stated that he knew of no priv- "
3990,ilege that “would entitle the President to withhold documentary 
3991,evidence of criminal misconduct on the part of Government employees 
3992,"or the White House staff."" He warned that assertion of a privilege "
3993,is “bound to be damaging to the President personally and to the 
3994,"office of the Presidency."" Cox told the White House in unequivocal "
3995,terms : 
3996,I have repeatedly given public assurance that I would report upon 
3997,any difficulty encountered in obtaining from the White House all 
3998,information material to our investigation. I am reluctant either to 
3999,take that course or to seek legal process before the opportunities 
4000,for cooperation have been exhausted. Further delay would be so 
4001,"prejudicial to our work, however, that I must insist upon a prompt, "
4002,categorical response to each of my prior requests and to the other 
4003,requests for specific papers that I shall undoubtedly have occasion 
4004,to make (including my letter of today's date). 
4005,"As the letter indicated, Cox also made a request on the same date "
4006,for additional information from the White House : 
4007,(1) logs showing telephone conversations and meetings on 
4008,"July 5 and 6, 1972, between the President and Clark MacGregor; "
4009,89
4010,"(2) copies of ""political matters memoranda” from Gordon "
4011,"Strachan to H. R. Haldeman, two former White House aides; "
4012,"(3) a copy of Dean's ""miscellaneous intelligence” file; "
4013,(4) a copy of the logs showing the specific items from the files 
4014,that had been copied by former White House staff members after 
4015,"April 30, 1973; and "
4016,(5) copies of any records of items inserted into the White 
4017,House files by former White House aides John Ehrlichman or 
4018,"David Young after April 30, 1973. "
4019,"The White House responded on July 21. Expressing ""great regret” "
4020,"for the delays, the President's attorney claimed that his office had been "
4021,extremely busy with the Senate Select Committee hearings and sub- 
4022,poenas in civil actions and that the requests of the Special Prosecutor 
4023,raised questions that had to be resolved by the President. Citing the 
4024,"President's international obligations and recent poor health, Buzhardt "
4025,"promised an early response to Cox's letter, but cautioned that ""obtain- "
4026,ing a decision from the President on sensitive questions that only he 
4027,can decide is often not a speedy process.” 
4028,Buzhardt's letter must be read in the context of the events that 
4029,"preceded it, beginning with testimony of Alexander Butterfield. "
4030,Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum 
4031,"On July 16, Alexander Butterfield, previously the President's "
4032,"staff secret ary, told the Senate Select Committee that an automatic "
4033,tape recording system had been installed in the President's White 
4034,House and Executive Office Building offices in early 1971. According to 
4035,"Butterfield, this system was capable of recording automatically all "
4036,telephone conversations and meetings in either office. 
4037,The significance of the President's recording system was immedi- 
4038,ately apparent. John Dean had testified that a number of his meetings 
4039,with the President had implicated the President and his high aides 
4040,in the Watergate cover-up. The recordings could provide invaluable 
4041,"corroboration for Dean's description of the meetings, as well as sup- "
4042,port his credibility on other aspects of his testimon}^ or they could 
4043,show that his statements had been untrue. 
4044,The Special Prosecutor was faced with two concerns in determining 
4045,"how to proceed. First, although Cox was generally optimistic that "
4046,"President Nixon, like all his predecessors in office, would abide by "
4047,"any final court determination, he was anxious to avoid a possible "
4048,constitutional confrontation between the judicial and executive 
4049,branches if the President were to disobey a court order to produce 
4050,"the recordings. Second, Cox was concerned that enforcement proceed- "
4051,ings necessarily would involve substantial delays in the investigation. 
4052,"Despite these concerns, Cox concluded that WSPF could not "
4053,proceed with the Watergate investigation without taking all possible 
4054,90
4055,steps to secure evidence that could be so important in determining 
4056,responsibility for the Watergate cover-up. 
4057,"Once he had decided to make a request for the recordings, Cox had "
4058,to choose the conversations most essential to the investigation. A 
4059,judicial decision would depend heavily on a balance between the need 
4060,for confidentiality in deliberations of the Executive Branch and the 
4061,need of the judicial process for evidence material to a criminal in- 
4062,vestigation and prosecution. Cox therefore chose the conversations 
4063,that appeared essential to determining the truth or falsity of Dean’s 
4064,allegations before the Senate Select Committee. The tapes of the 
4065,actual conversations woidd be crucial to the resolution of the grand 
4066,"jury’s investigation. In addition, Cox picked those meetings which, "
4067,"from the available circumstantial evidence, would reveal the forma- "
4068,tion of any conspiracy — these included meetings of the President 
4069,"with Ehrlichman and Haldeman shortly after the break-in, one of the "
4070,first conversations between the President and Mitchell after the 
4071,"break-in, and the meeting between the President and Mitchell on the "
4072,day preceding Mitchell’s resignation as director of CRP. 
4073,"On July 18, Cox wrote to Buzhardt requesting access to the tape "
4074,recordings of nine specified conversations. He emphasized “ three 
4075,"essential aspects” of the request: first, the materiality of the record- "
4076,"ings to the investigation of serious criminal misconduct; second, the "
4077,lack of any separation of powers issue because the request was being 
4078,"made by a prosecutor within the executive branch, and not, for "
4079,"example, by the Senate Select Committee; and third, the confidenti- "
4080,"ality that attached to grand jury proceedings. On July 23, Charles "
4081,Alan Wright responded with the President’s instructions that it would 
4082,"not be possible to make available the requested recordings, for reasons "
4083,similar to those stated to Senator Ervin in denying a Senate Select 
4084,"Committee request. In addition, Wright argued that as part of the "
4085,"executive branch, the Special Prosecutor was subject to the direction "
4086,of the President or the Attorney General and could not have access 
4087,to Presidential papers unless the President saw fit to grant access. 
4088,He argued: 
4089,"It is for the President, and only for the President to weigh "
4090,whether the incremental advantage that these tapes would give 
4091,you in criminal proceedings justifies the serious and lasting hurt 
4092,that disclosure of them would do to the confidentiality that is 
4093,imperative to the effective functioning of the Presidency. In this 
4094,instance the President has concluded that it would not serve the 
4095,public interest to make the tapes available. 
4096,"In a letter to Senator Ervin written the same day, the President "
4097,indicated that “[i]f release of the tapes would settle the central 
4098,"questions at issue in the Watergate inquiries, then their disclosure "
4099,might serve a substantial public interest that would have to be weighed 
4100,very heavily against the negatives of disclosure.” He claimed that 
4101,91
4102,"the tapes “would not finally settle the central issues,” but that he "
4103,had personally listened to a number of the tapes and they were 
4104,“entirely consistent with what I know to be the truth and what I 
4105,have stated to be the truth.” 
4106,"Upon receiving Wright’s response, Cox announced at a press "
4107,conference that he immediately would seek subpoenas to obtain the 
4108,recordings. A subpoena returnable on July 26 was served immediately 
4109,on the President’s counsel. 1 
4110,"On July 25, the President wrote to Chief Judge Sirica and refused "
4111,to comply with Cox’s subpoena. He said he was following the example 
4112,of predecessors who had “consistently adhered to the position that the 
4113,"President is not subject to compulsory process from the courts,” and "
4114,stated that it would be “inconsistent with the public interest and with 
4115,the constitutional position of the Presidency to make available re- 
4116,cordings of meetings and telephone conversations in which I was a 
4117,participant.” 2 
4118,"The next morning, Cox explained to the grand jurors the Presi- "
4119,dent’s refusal to comply with the subpoena and sought the grand 
4120,jury’s authorization to request an order from Chief Judge Sirica 
4121,compelling the production of the tapes. Upon the unanimous vote of 
4122,"the grand jurors, the Special Prosecutor filed a petition for an order "
4123,directing the President to show cause why the subpoenaed materials 
4124,"should not be produced. In the petition, the Special Prosecutor "
4125,claimed that the grand jury had an enforceable right to access to the 
4126,"recordings, which were relevant and important to its investigations, "
4127,"and that the President, in a public statement on May 22, 1973, had "
4128,waived any claim of executive privilege. (This statement authorized 
4129,his aides to testify about Watergate before the Senate Select Commit- 
4130,"tee.) Finally, the petition argued that it was the responsibility of the "
4131,"courts, and not the exclusive prerogative of the President, to de- "
4132,termine whether a claim of privilege to withhold evidence from the 
4133,courts was valid. After polling the grand jurors in open court and 
4134,"determining that it was their wish that the subpoena be enforced, "
4135,"Chief Judge Sirica signed the order to show cause, returnable on "
4136,August 7. 
4137,"1 In addition to the tapes and related notes and memoranda, the subpoena "
4138,called for the original of a memorandum on the termination of E. Howard Hunt 
4139,as a White House consultant (a copy previously had been given to the FBI) and 
4140,the “ Political Matters Memoranda” prepared for Haldeman by Strachan. Cox 
4141,believed that neither item was subject even to an arguable claim of privilege. 
4142,"2 Nevertheless, he stated that, like his predecessors, he would voluntarily "
4143,make available relevant material where that would not be “inconsistent with the 
4144,public interest.” He wrote that he was “voluntarily transmitting for the use of 
4145,the grand jury” the memorandum on Hunt’s termination and Strachan’s Political 
4146,Matters Memoranda. (The Hunt termination memorandum was enclosed with 
4147,"the letter, but the Political Matters Memoranda were not. They were not made "
4148,available to the Special Prosecutor until September.) 
4149,92
4150,"On the return date, President Nixon filed a special appearance "
4151,in which he contended that the order should be vacated because the 
4152,court lacked jurisdiction to compel the President to comply with a 
4153,subpoena. 3 The accompanying brief argued that compelled disclosure 
4154,of the recordings not only would result in “severe and irreparable” 
4155,"damage “to the institution of the Presidency,” but also would violate "
4156,the constitutional doctrine of the separation of pjowers. 
4157,"The Special Prosecutor replied to this brief on August 13, arguing "
4158,"that the courts, as the historic arbiters of the Constitution, have the "
4159,final authority to determine whether the executive can be required to 
4160,produce evidence for use in a judicial proceeding and that the Presi- 
4161,dent is not absolutely immune from orders requiring him to comply 
4162,"with constitutional duties, including the production of unprivileged "
4163,evidence. Acknowledging that the courts had recognized a qualified 
4164,privilege in the interest of promoting candid policy discussions among 
4165,"executive officials, the Special Prosecutor contended that the privilege "
4166,did not apply where there was reason to believe that the discussions 
4167,"may have involved criminal wrongdoing, and that, under the circum- "
4168,"stances, the need of the grand jury for the subpoenaed recordings "
4169,outweighed the public interest served by the confidentiality of execu- 
4170,"tive deliberations. Finally, the Special Prosecutor argued that any "
4171,privilege attaching to the particular recordings had been waived 
4172,by the President’s consent to other disclosures of their content. 
4173,"In his reply brief, the President claimed for the first time in court "
4174,that he had ultimate responsibility for the prosecution of criminal 
4175,cases and thus had ultimate control of what evidence would be pro- 
4176,duced for a criminal proceeding by the United States. The Special 
4177,Prosecutor responded that the evidence was being sought by the 
4178,"grand jury, that the grand jury had independent authority to seek "
4179,"evidence wherever it might be, that the grand jury was not subject "
4180,"to the unfettered control of the executive branch, and that, in seeking "
4181,"enforcement of the subpoena, the Special Prosecutor was acting as "
4182,the attorney for the grand jury and not merely as a subordinate mem- 
4183,ber of the executive branch. 
4184,"The issues were argued on August 22, 1973, before Chief Judge "
4185,"Sirica. The arguments were essentially those set forth in the briefs, "
4186,"with one notable exception. In his rebuttal argument, Wright stated "
4187,that the President had told him that one of the subpoenaed tapes 
4188,contained “national security material so highly sensitive” that the 
4189,"President could not even “hint” to Wright, who had a top secret "
4190,"clearance, the nature of the information. 4 "
4191,3 A special appearance permits a party to argue that the court lacks jurisdic- 
4192,tion without submitting to the court’s jurisdiction by the very fact of appearing. 
4193,"4 When the recordings eventually were produced, no claim relating to national "
4194,"security was made, and it soon became apparent that the tapes did not include "
4195,any classified information. 
4196,93
4197,591-439 0 - 75-7 
4198,"On August 29, 1973, Chief Judge Sirica ruled that the courts, and "
4199,"not the President, must make the ultimate determination of the "
4200,validity and scope of any privilege asserted to bar them from obtain- 
4201,ing evidence relevant to their proceedings and that they have the 
4202,power to order a President to comply with a grand jury subpoena 
4203,calling for unprivileged evidence in his possession. Although the 
4204,"judge emphasized the need of the grand jury, he seemed to suggest "
4205,that the privilege would yield only with respect to those conversations 
4206,that did not occur pursuant to the President's exercise of his duty 
4207,"“to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,"" that is, those "
4208,conversations that on their face revealed a criminal conspiracy. 
4209,"Clearly, mere relevance to Watergate was not the test. The judge "
4210,ordered the President to produce the subpoenaed materials for court 
4211,"inspection, but stayed his order for five days to permit the President "
4212,to seek appellate review. 
4213,"Without awaiting the formal filing of papers, the Court of Appeals "
4214,informally indicated to the parties that if review were sought the 
4215,"Court would hear oral arguments on September 11, using the briefs "
4216,in the district court and any supplemental briefs the parties wished 
4217,to file on September 10. Although objecting to the expeditious sched- 
4218,"ule, the President, after both noting an appeal and filing a petition "
4219,"for a writ of mandamus, filed a new brief in the Court of Appeals "
4220,developing at greater length the issues that he had raised in the district 
4221,court. The Special Prosecutor also petitioned the Court of Appeals 
4222,"for review, arguing that inspection by Chief Judge Sirica was un- "
4223,necessary because no valid claim of executive privilege could exist 
4224,for any conversations actually relevant to the grand jury's proceedings. 
4225,"Alternatively, the Special Prosecutor asked the Court of Appeals "
4226,to specify the particular standards that should govern the judge's 
4227,inspection and argued that informed determinations of relevance 
4228,could be made only with the Special Prosecutor's participation in 
4229,the review. 
4230,"On September 13, two days after oral argument, the Court of "
4231,Appeals directed the parties to explore the possibility of reaching an 
4232,agreement on voluntary submission of certain portions of the sub- 
4233,poenaed recordings to the grand jury. As the Court of Appeals stated: 
4234,[I]f the President and the Special Prosecutor agree as to the 
4235,"material needed for the grand jury's functioning, the national "
4236,"interest will be served. At the same time, neither the President "
4237,nor the Special Prosecutor would in any way have surrendered 
4238,or subverted the principles for which they have contended. 
4239,"After initial discussions, the Special Prosecutor submitted to the "
4240,President's counsel a proposal that called for preparation of copies 
4241,of the tapes with omissions of any portions not related to matters 
4242,94
4243,within the Special Prosecutor’s jurisdiction; verification by a mutually 
4244,acceptable person of the fact that the guidelines for omission had 
4245,been accurately applied; and finality of the reviewer’s determination. 
4246,"Before submission to the grand jury, the Special Prosecutor and "
4247,counsel for the President would review the copies in an endeavor 
4248,to agree upon the excision of any portion that was not material to the 
4249,grand jury’s investigation. Most important from the Special Prose- 
4250,"cutor’s viewpoint, the proposal included procedures for reviewing "
4251,"tapes that the Special Prosecutor might request in the future, either "
4252,for the Watergate cover-up investigation or other grand jury investiga- 
4253,tions. A favorable court ruling at that time would have governed future 
4254,"requests, and if the Special Prosecutor were to forego final court "
4255,resolution — after nearly two months of litigation — it was essential 
4256,not to have to start from the beginning again if there should be another 
4257,impasse over access. The proposal was unacceptable to the White 
4258,"House, however, and on September 20 both parties advised the "
4259,Court that their discussions had been unsuccessful. 
4260,"On October 12, the Court of Appeals, en banc, issued its decision "
4261,rejecting the President’s claims. The Court first decided that a Presi- 
4262,dent is not immune from judicial orders requiring the production of 
4263,"evidence for judicial proceedings. According to the Court, “sovereignty "
4264,"remains at all times with the people, and they do not forfeit "
4265,through elections the right to have the law construed against and 
4266,applied to every citizen.” Citing the long-standing principle that the 
4267,"grand jury has a right to every person’s evidence, the Court then "
4268,"held that executive privilege is not absolute, but must be balanced "
4269,"against other values. In this case, the Court ruled, the compelling "
4270,need demonstrated by the grand jury outweighed the need of the 
4271,executive branch to maintain the confidentiality of the particular 
4272,conversations. In this regard the Court considered it important that 
4273,public testimony concerning the conversations had substantially 
4274,"diminished any interest in maintaining further confidentiality. Finally, "
4275,the Court emphasized that the standard for court screening of the 
4276,"tapes was only to be one of relevance to the grand jury’s proceedings, "
4277,"and not whether the President, in participating in the conversation, "
4278,was engaging in his constitutional duties. The Court stayed its order 
4279,for five days to permit the President to seek review in the Supreme 
4280,Court. 
4281,The Stennis Compromise and the Dismissal of Cox 
4282,"On the Friday afternoon of the Court of Appeals decision, but "
4283,"before it had been announced, Cox met with Attorney General "
4284,"Richardson about an unrelated matter. During the meeting, Richard- "
4285,son philosophized about the need for a public official to know when to 
4286,"take a stand on a matter of principle. The following Monday, during "
4287,"another meeting hastily called by the Attorney General, Richardson "
4288,stated that “serious consequences” might ensue if Cox were not to 
4289,"agree to a compromise on the tapes by the close of business Friday, "
4290,"October 19, the date on which the President was due to file his petition "
4291,for review by the Supreme Court. Although Cox expressed great 
4292,"reservations about negotiating under a deadline, and argued that "
4293,"there was no need to complete the negotiations so rapidly, he agreed "
4294,to explore the possibility of a compromise. 
4295,After another meeting with Richardson on Tuesday the 16 th> 
4296,when Cox suggested that it would be best if Richardson were to put 
4297,"his proposal in writing, Richardson the next day delivered to Cox a "
4298,document entitled “A Proposal.” The stated objective was to provide 
4299,“a means of furnishing to the court and the grand jury a complete 
4300,and accurate record of the content of the tapes subpoenaed by the 
4301,Special Prosecutor insofar as the conversations recorded in those tapes 
4302,in any way relate to the Watergate break-in and the cover-up of the 
4303,break in.” The proposal provided that the President would select an 
4304,individual to verify transcripts previously prepared by the White 
4305,"House — transcripts that would be verbatim, but would omit continu- "
4306,ous portions unrelated to Watergate and would be in the “third 
4307,person.” The verifier would be permitted to paraphrase language 
4308,“whose use in its original form would in his judgment be embarrass- 
4309,"ing to the President” and, in the interests of national security, to "
4310,omit sections related to the national defense or foreign relations. 
4311,"Finally, the proposal would require the Special Prosecutor to join "
4312,with counsel for the President in urging the Court to accept the 
4313,verified transcripts as full and accurate records of all pertinent por- 
4314,tions of the tapes “for all purposes for which access to those tapes 
4315,might thereafter be sought by or on behalf of any person having 
4316,standing to obtain such access.” 
4317,Cox responded to Richardson on Thursday the 18th in a document 
4318,entitled “Comments on ‘A Proposal/ ” He stated his willingness to 
4319,"accept the “essential idea of establishing impartial, but non-judicial "
4320,means for providing the Special Prosecutor and grand jury with an 
4321,accurate record of the contents of the tapes without [the Special 
4322,"Prosecutor’s] participation,” but listing eleven specific comments "
4323,"that struck him as “highly important,” including the following: "
4324,(1) The public cannot be fairly asked to confide so difficult 
4325,"and responsible a task to any one man operating in secrecy, "
4326,consulting only with the White House. Nor should we be put in 
4327,the position of accepting any choice made unilaterally. 
4328,(2) The stated objective of the proposal is too narrow. It 
4329,should include providing evidence that in any way relates to other 
4330,possible criminal activity under the jurisdiction of this office. 
4331,(3) I do not understand the implications of saying that the 
4332,“verbatim transcript . . . would be in the third person.” I do 
4333,96
4334,"assume that the names of all speakers, of all persons addressed by "
4335,"name or tone, and of all persons mentioned would be included. "
4336,(4) A “transcript” prepared in the manner projected might be 
4337,enough for investigation by the Special Prosecutor and the grand 
4338,jury. If we accept such a “transcript” we would try to get it 
4339,accepted by the courts (as you suggest). There must also be 
4340,"assurance, however, that if the indictments are returned, if evidence "
4341,"concerning any of the nine conversations would, in our judgement, "
4342,"be important at the trial, and if the court will not accept our "
4343,“transcript” then the evidence will be furnished to the prosecution 
4344,in whatever form the trial court rules is necessary for admissibility 
4345,(including as much of the original tape as the court requires). 
4346,"Similarly, if the court rules that a tape or any portion must be "
4347,"furnished to a defendant or the case will be dismissed, then the "
4348,tape must be supplied. 
4349,"(5) The narrow scope of the proposal is a grave defect, because "
4350,it would not serve the function of court decision in establishing 
4351,the Special Prosecutor’s entitlement to other evidence. We have 
4352,long pending requests for many specific documents. The proposal 
4353,"also leaves half a lawsuit hanging (i.e., the subpoenaed papers). "
4354,Some method of resolving these problems is required. 
4355,(6) The Watergate Special Prosecution Force was established 
4356,because of a widely felt need to create an independent office that 
4357,would objectively and forthrightly pursue the prima facie showing 
4358,"of criminality by high Government officials. You appointed me, "
4359,and I have pledged that I would not be turned aside. Any solution 
4360,I can accept must be such as to command conviction that I am 
4361,adhering to that pledge. 
4362,"Later that night, Wright telephoned Cox to inform him that cer- "
4363,tain of his comments were unacceptable. Cox realized that a confronta- 
4364,tion was inevitable and believed that all communications should be 
4365,in writing so that there would be a record of each side’s position. He 
4366,", asked Wright to address a letter stating the President’s response to "
4367,the comments that Cox had delivered to Richardson. Cox promised a 
4368,prompt reply. 
4369,"Early on Friday morning, October 19, Wright’s letter was de- "
4370,"livered. Briefly, it stated that the “very reasonable proposal that the "
4371,"Attorney General put to you, at the instance of the President,” was "
4372,intended to provide information necessary to the grand jury and to 
4373,“put to rest any possible thought that the President might himself 
4374,have been involved in the Watergate break-in or cover-up.” Wright 
4375,stated the President’s belief that the proposal would serve the national 
4376,"interest, but that four of Mr. Cox’s comments “depart so far from that "
4377,proposal and the purpose for which it was made that we could not 
4378,accede to them in any form.” The four unacceptable comments 
4379,included the objection to one person reviewing the tapes and to that 
4380,person being selected solely by the White House; the suggestion 
4381,that the reviewers be appointed “special masters” and thus account- 
4382,able to the court rather than the parties; the demand that the tapes 
4383,97
4384,be made available if a court required; and the demand that the 
4385,"proposal also be applied to pending and future requests. Finally, "
4386,Wright said : 
4387,"If you think that there is any purpose in our talking further, "
4388,"my associates and I stand ready to do so. If not, we will have to "
4389,follow the course of action that we think in the best interest of 
4390,the country. 
4391,"Cox replied as requested by 10:00 that morning, setting forth his "
4392,"understanding of the conversation the preceding evening — that is, "
4393,that Wright had stated that there was no point in continuing conversa- 
4394,tions in an effort to reach a “reasonable out of court accommodation” 
4395,unless Cox accepted categorically the President's position with respect 
4396,to certain key provisions. In addition to stating that the President 
4397,already had selected the only person he would consider acceptable to 
4398,"review the tapes, that there could not be a special master under a "
4399,"court order, and that no portion of the tapes themselves would be "
4400,"provided under any circumstances, Wright had indicated that Cox "
4401,"would have to agree not to subpoena any other White House tapes, "
4402,"papers, or documents, no matter how relevant to criminal wrongdoing "
4403,"by White House officials. In conclusion, Cox wrote: "
4404,"I have a strong desire to avoid any form of confrontation, but "
4405,I could not conscientiously agree to your stipulations without 
4406,unfaithfulness to the pledges which I gave the Senate prior to my 
4407,appointment. It is enough to point out that the fourth stipulation 
4408,would require me to forego further legal challenge to claims of 
4409,executive privilege. I categorically assured the Senate Judiciary 
4410,Committee that I would challenge such claims so far as the law 
4411,permitted. The Attorney General was confirmed on the strength 
4412,of that assurance. I cannot break my promise now. 
4413,Wright responded that “further discussions between us seeking to 
4414,"resolve this matter by compromise would be futile, ... we will be "
4415,forced to take the actions that the President deems appropriate in the 
4416,circumstances.” He added that he wished to clear up two points “in 
4417,"the interest of historical accuracy, in the unhappy event that our "
4418,"correspondence should see the light of day.” First, he said that the "
4419,issue of eventual availability of the tapes was a matter open to negotia- 
4420,"tion, but that the President would not give any advance commitment; "
4421,"second, the Special Prosecutor would be barred only from subpoenaing "
4422,"“private Presidential papers and meetings,” not the great mass of "
4423,White House documents with which the President was not personally 
4424,involved. 
4425,"That night, October 19, President Nixon issued a statement setting "
4426,forth the so-called “Stennis compromise” and announcing his decision 
4427,not to seek Supreme Court review of the Court of Appeals decision. 
4428,"The “Stennis compromise,” which accorded with the basic outlines of "
4429,"the Richardson proposal of Wednesday morning, provided that Sena- "
4430,tor John Stennis would review the tapes to verify the White House 
4431,transcripts and that the President would make available to Judge 
4432,"Sirica, as well as to the Senate Select Committee, the Watergate- "
4433,related portions of the authenticated transcripts. 
4434,"At the same time, the President delivered a letter to Attorney "
4435,General Richardson directing him to instruct Cox “to make no further 
4436,"attempts by judicial process to obtain tapes, notes, or memoranda "
4437,of Presidential conversations.” He added that he regretted “the 
4438,"necessity of intruding, to this very limited extent, on the independence "
4439,that I promised you with regard to Watergate when I announced 
4440,your appointment. This would not have been necessary if the Special 
4441,Prosecutor had agreed to the very reasonable proposal you made to 
4442,"him this week.” Richardson told Cox about the letter, but emphasized "
4443,that he was not delivering the instructions that the President had 
4444,directed him to give. 
4445,Cox hurriedly prepared a brief statement which he read to the 
4446,press that evening. Accusing the President of “refusing to comply 
4447,"with the court decrees,” Cox stated that he would challenge the "
4448,Stennis compromise in court. He added that he could not “violate” 
4449,his promise to the Senate and the country to invoke judicial process 
4450,“to challenge exaggerated claims of executive privilege.” In an hour- 
4451,"long press conference held at noon the following day, October 20, "
4452,Cox elaborated on his belief that acceptance of the President’s direc- 
4453,tions would defeat the fair administration of criminal justice by 
4454,compromising the Special Prosecutor’s independence and insulating 
4455,the President from the courts. 
4456,The dismissal of Cox and related events are described in Chapter 
4457,1 and Appendix B of this report. Public reaction played a substantial 
4458,part in the President’s later decision to comply in full with the court 
4459,order and to abandon the Stennis plan. When Wright appeared before 
4460,"Judge Sirica on Tuesday, October 23, he announced that because of "
4461,"“the events of the weekend,” the President had decided to abide "
4462,by the Court of Appeals ruling. 
4463,Production of the Subpoenaed Materials and the Tapes Hearings 
4464,"In the week that followed the President’s reversal, the parties "
4465,agreed on procedures and a timetable for production of the subpoenaed 
4466,tapes and related materials. Chief Judge Sirica announced on October 
4467,30 that White House counsel would submit the tapes with an accom- 
4468,panying analysis indicating the portions of the recordings that did not 
4469,relate to Watergate and thus were still privileged. Judge Sirica then 
4470,99
4471,"would review each recording, and give the grand jury all portions "
4472,relevant to its investigation. 5 
4473,"On October 31, however, Buzhardt reported to the Court that "
4474,recordings of the telephone call from Mitchell to President Nixon on 
4475,"June 20, 1972, and the meeting between President Nixon and Dean "
4476,"on April 15, 1973, did not exist. As Buzhardt later explained, the June "
4477,"20 telephone call, received by the President in the residence area of the "
4478,"White House, had not been recorded, and the Dean meeting was not "
4479,recorded because the tape had run out earlier on the busy Sunday of 
4480,April 15. 
4481,"After conferring with the parties, Chief Judge Sirica decided to "
4482,hold hearings to explore how the taping system had been installed 
4483,"and maintained, how the tapes were stored, who had access to them, "
4484,and why the June 20 call and April 15 meeting had not been recorded. 
4485,"These hearings, primarily with the testimony of Secret Service agents "
4486,"and White House aides who had been responsible for the system, lasted "
4487,approximately two weeks and then were recessed. 
4488,"On November 21, Buzhardt disclosed that 18^ minutes of the "
4489,"recording of the June 20, 1972, meeting between President Nixon and "
4490,"Haldeman had been obliterated, 6 Only a buzzing sound could be heard. "
4491,Haldeman’s notes of the meeting confirmed that the erased portion 
4492,concerned Watergate. Chief Judge Sirica reconvened the tapes hear- 
4493,"ings, with testimony from Woods (who admitted accidentally erasing "
4494,"a short segment of the 183^ minutes), White House chief of staff Gen. "
4495,"Alexander Haig, Buzhardt, and White House aide Stephen Bull. "
4496,"The Court, with the* consent of the parties, also appointed a six-mem- "
4497,ber panel of experts to test and analyze the tapes. Upon conclusion of 
4498,"hearings and receipt of the expend report, Chief Judge Sirica referred "
4499,the record of the proceedings to the grand jury for its consideration. 
4500,(This investigation is described in Chapter 3 of this report.) 
4501,Renewed Requests for Tapes and Documents 
4502,One of the principal issues during the period between Cox's 
4503,dismissal and the appointment of Special Prosecutor Jaworski was 
4504,5 The only recording that White House counsel asserted was totally unrelated 
4505,"to Watergate was the recording of the June 30, 1972, meeting between President "
4506,Nixon and Mitchell. After reviewing the recording and consulting with the 
4507,"Special Prosecutor, the judge determined that two brief passages should be "
4508,submitted to the grand jury. 
4509,White House counsel also asserted privilege with respect to the final portion 
4510,"of the September 15, 1972, meeting among President Nixon, Dean and Haldeman. "
4511,"The judge upheld the claim, but upon motion of the Special Prosecutor later "
4512,released the portion to a different grand jury in connection with the investigation 
4513,into alleged White House misuse of the Internal Revenue Service. 
4514,"6 Subsequently, White House counsel revealed the existence of much shorter "
4515,gaps in the President’s taped recollections of his June 20 telephone call with 
4516,"Mitchell and his March 21, 1973 meeting with Haldeman and Dean. "
4517,100
4518,"whether the officials of the Department, including Acting Attorney "
4519,"General Bork and Assistant Attorney General Petersen, who had "
4520,"taken charge of the Special Prosecutor's investigations, would stand "
4521,behind the staff in seeking evidentiary material in the control of 
4522,the President. Although Cox had refrained from making many re- 
4523,"quests pending the outcome of the tapes litigation, three of WSPF's "
4524,recent letters requesting documents had not been answered. On 
4525,"August 23, Cox had written to Buzhardt requesting a series of records "
4526,relating to the office's investigation of the “Plumbers” break-in at 
4527,"the office of Dr. Lewis Fielding, Daniel Ellsberg's former psychiatrist. "
4528,Four days later he had requested records relating to the investigation 
4529,"of the wiretap of journalist Joseph Kraft, and on October 10 he had "
4530,"requested documents relating to the May 3, 1972, assault on anti-war "
4531,demonstrators on the Capitol steps. The office had not received a 
4532,"definitive response to any of these requests, nor to other requests "
4533,that had been made long before the subpoena for the Presidential 
4534,tapes had been served. 
4535,Petersen agreed to renew each of the requests after reviewing 
4536,WSPF's ongoing investigations with individual task force leaders 
4537,and determining that there was “a clear and immediate need for the 
4538,"production of the documents and other records.” On November 1, "
4539,he addressed a letter to Buzhardt asking for quick production of the 
4540,"logs of meetings between ten individuals and the President, a request "
4541,"that had been outstanding since June, and reiterating the requests "
4542,"of August and October relating to the Fielding break-in, the Kraft "
4543,"wiretap, and the May 3 assault. The next day he requested all records "
4544,relating to the 1970 “Townhouse” operation—a funding operation 
4545,for congressional candidates — in connection with an investigation 
4546,into possible violations of the Federal Corrupt Practices Act. 
4547,"On November 5, Leon Jaworski was sworn in as the second Special "
4548,Prosecutor with assurances of full cooperation from the White House. 
4549,"On November 7, after an initial round of briefings on the status of "
4550,"all investigations, Jaworski made his first request for materials: "
4551,copies of recordings of conversations between the President and 
4552,"Ehrlichman, Mitchell and Kleindienst on April 19 and 20, 1971, "
4553,relating to the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation 
4554,"(“ITT”). On the following day, he renewed the earlier requests for "
4555,"materials in the “Plumbers” files, and on November 15, he requested "
4556,copies of recordings of conversations between the President and his 
4557,former assistant Charles Colson in early January 1973 for use in 
4558,"the Watergate investigation. In each of his letters, Jaworski asked for "
4559,an early response. 
4560,"Jaworski had met with Buzhardt and General Alexander Haig, "
4561,"the President's Chief of Staff, on November 13 in part to discuss his "
4562,recent requests for tape recordings and to stress the grand juries' need 
4563,for prompt responses. They assured Jaworski that cooperation would 
4564,101
4565,"be forthcoming. Then, on November 19, Jaworski wrote to Buzhardt "
4566,asking him to respond to the outstanding requests made before the 
4567,dismissal of Cox and the more recent requests made by Petersen. 
4568,He stated that failure to respond was “delaying and in some instances 
4569,impeding our investigations.” Jaworski made it clear that he would 
4570,not tolerate any delays like those experienced by Cox: 
4571,"In light of past experience, I believe it entirely appropriate to "
4572,ask you to acknowledge each of these requests and explain your 
4573,"current position. As to those materials you intend to produce, "
4574,please let us know when you expect to produce them. If you must 
4575,"review certain materials, please let us know when you will review "
4576,"them and when we. can expect a definitive response. Finally, if "
4577,there are any materials you do not plan to produce in response to 
4578,"our requests, please identify them and inform us why you are not "
4579,producing them. 
4580,"On November 24, Jaworski received an omnibus response from "
4581,Buzhardt on outstanding requests. He stated that although searches 
4582,"for requested recordings require “enormous expenditures of time,” "
4583,the recordings that could be located would be provided. He then 
4584,"responded specifically to each request for documents, enclosing the "
4585,"documents that could be found and stating which could not. In short, "
4586,Buzhardt's letter constituted a seemingly favorable response to many 
4587,"WSPF requests, but as Jaworski indicated in his reply of November "
4588,"30, it merely acknowledged the existence of other requests, particu- "
4589,"larly in the Watergate and “Plumbers” areas, without indicating "
4590,whether they would be met. Jaworski also protested the intimation in 
4591,Buzhardt's letter that the Special Prosecutor's office had been less 
4592,"than cooperative in understanding the attendant delays, and con- "
4593,cluded “that if our several requests are treated in the light of the 
4594,White House's announced readiness to extend full cooperation — and 
4595,we have no reason to believe otherwise — unequivocal response to our 
4596,remaining requests should be forthcoming in another week or ten 
4597,days.” 
4598,In the following week the office renewed the request for Townhouse 
4599,"documents, only a few of which had been provided ; made an extensive "
4600,request for records relating to the investigation of dairy industry 
4601,"contributions; and renewed the request in more detailed form, for "
4602,"materials in the “Plumbers” files. On December 6, Jaworski also "
4603,"wrote to Haig, complaining that over three weeks had elapsed since "
4604,their meeting on November 13 when Haig and Buzhardt had promised 
4605,cooperation. Although certain documents had been provided on Nov- 
4606,"ember 24, no tapes had been produced. Stressing the immediate "
4607,"need for delivery of the requested tapes and other materials, including "
4608,the “Plumbers” files and files relating to contributions by the dairy 
4609,"industry, Jaworski warned that a subpoena would be issued early "
4610,the next week if necessary. 
4611,102
4612,"The next day, Jaworski met with Haig and Buzhardt, and on "
4613,"December 8, the White House produced eight of the requested "
4614,"recordings. These related to the ITT investigation, the dairy industry "
4615,"investigation, the “Plumbers,” and the Watergate investigation. "
4616,The White House claimed that other requested conversations had not 
4617,"been recorded, either because they had taken place outside of the "
4618,White House or because the telephone conversations were on lines 
4619,"that were not subject to the recording system. Finally, Haig and Buz- "
4620,hardt maintained that still other conversations were irrelevant to the 
4621,"investigations; it was agreed, however, that Jaworski would be "
4622,"allowed to review them, and one which Jaworski determined to be "
4623,relevant was later produced. The White House also agreed to allow 
4624,a member of the staff to review the files of the “Plumbers” unit. 
4625,During his appearance at the Senate Judiciary Committee’s 
4626,confirmation hearings on the nomination of William Saxbe to be 
4627,"Attorney General, Jaworski had assured the Committee that he would "
4628,report at an appropriate time on the status of the office’s efforts to 
4629,"obtain evidence from the White House. On December 13, in a letter "
4630,"to Committee Chairman James Eastland, Jaworski reported “sig- "
4631,nificant cooperation from the White House” and stated that he hoped 
4632,for a “mutually satisfactory resolution” of pending requests. 
4633,Access After the Commencement of the Impeachment Inquiry 
4634,"In January of 1974, James D. St. Clair was appointed as the "
4635,President’s chief counsel for “Watergate”-related matters. By that 
4636,"time, the impeachment inquiry by the House Judiciary Committee "
4637,had begun in earnest. It was clear from the outset that the arrival of 
4638,St. Clair would occasion further delays in obtaining information from 
4639,the White House. St. Clair needed time to acquaint himself not only 
4640,with “Watergate” in general and the President’s potential liability in 
4641,"any area of the Special Prosecutor’s requests, but also with prior "
4642,relationships and understandings between WSPF and the White 
4643,House. The Special Prosecutor believed it essential to renew the re- 
4644,quests that were outstanding and to emphasize to St. Clair that 
4645,"inordinate delays would be intolerable. Accordingly, on January 8, "
4646,Deputy Special Prosecutor Henry Ruth addressed a letter to St. Clair 
4647,asking for specified items relating to the office’s investigation of the 
4648,"dairy industry. 7 The next day, Jaworski requested recordings of 25 "
4649,meetings or telephone conversations relating to the Watergate cover-up 
4650,"investigation, explaining that these tapes were necessary to permit as "
4651,full an investigation as possible before any indictments were returned. 
4652,"On January 22, Jaworski met with St. Clair, who indicated that "
4653,the President would not make a decision with respect to the January 9 
4654,7 Jaworski had recused himself from all matters regarding this investigation. 
4655,103
4656,requests until the Special Prosecutor provided a justification for each 
4657,"of the requested recordings. That same day, although stating that he "
4658,did not believe that a showing of “particularized need” was required 
4659,"for each conversation, Jaworski sent St. Clair an explanation of the "
4660,importance of each conversation to the Watergate investigation. 
4661,"At the same meeting, Jaworski and St. Clair also discussed the "
4662,possibility of obtaining the President's testimony before the grand 
4663,jury. St. Clair suggested that Jaworski consider propounding written 
4664,"interrogatories to the President, with the possibility of Jaworski "
4665,conducting a personal interview after the President answered the 
4666,interrogatories. Jaworski countered with the suggestion that the grand 
4667,"jury come to the White House, an alternative that St. Clair said would "
4668,"be unacceptable. The following day, Jaworski wrote St. Clair that "
4669,written interrogatories generally are not a useful or effective method 
4670,"for obtaining a person's testimony. But, in order to consider fully the "
4671,"St. Clair proposal, Jaworski asked that St. Clair determine whether "
4672,"the President would answer under oath, how long it would take the "
4673,"President to provide answers, whether tapes and documents relevant "
4674,"to the answers would be provided, and who, in addition to the Special "
4675,"Prosecutor, would be permitted to interview the President after the "
4676,"interrogatories were answered. On January 25, St. Clair responded that "
4677,he was prepared to recommend to the President that the answers to 
4678,"the interrogatories be given under oath, but that in light of the ma- "
4679,"terials already provided to the Special Prosecutor, it would not be "
4680,suitable to provide further tapes and documents. He also indicated 
4681,that only Jaworski should conduct the interview. 
4682,"As to the January 9 request for Watergate-related tapes, St. Clair "
4683,"claimed that under the Court of Appeals decision of October 12, 1973, "
4684,"in Nixon v. Sirica , WSPF had to show a “uniquely powerful'' need for "
4685,the tapes and that they constituted “evidence for which no effective 
4686,"substitute is available.” The tapes requested, he contended, were "
4687,merely cumulative of the testimony of witnesses before the Senate 
4688,Select Committee and thus could serve only as corroboration for the 
4689,grand jury. Although he concluded that the January 22 justifications 
4690,"for Watergate tapes did not meet these requirements, he stated that "
4691,no final decision had been made as to whether the material called 
4692,for would be produced voluntarily and promised a definitive response 
4693,early the next week. 
4694,"During the first month after St. Clair arrived, the only items pro- "
4695,duced were those that had been promised during 1973. Each time 
4696,items were delivered to the Special Prosecutor they were accompanied 
4697,by a letter stating that the materials were being furnished “solely 
4698,for your use in presenting evidence to the grand jury.” It became clear 
4699,over the next weeks that St. Clair was primarily concerned that evid- 
4700,ence produced for the grand jury not subsequently be provided by 
4701,WSPF to the House Judiciary Committee for use in its impeachment 
4702,104
4703,inquiry. Believing it necessary to clarify the status of the materials 
4704,"received, Jaworski wrote to St. Clair on January 25, stating that the "
4705,office would lay before the grand jury any relevant evidence bearing 
4706,"on matters within the Special Prosecutor’s jurisdiction, but that it "
4707,"was necessarily implicit that, if the grand jury were to return in- "
4708,"dictments, any evidence provided to the office, whether under subpoena "
4709,"or voluntarily, could be used at any trials resulting from grand jury "
4710,investigations. 
4711,On January 30 Jaworski again asked St. Clair by letter for a re- 
4712,"sponse to WSPF’s numerous outstanding requests. 8 That night, in "
4713,"his State of the Union Address, the President said that he had turned "
4714,over all the evidence that the Special Prosecutor needed to complete 
4715,his Watergate investigation. In a similar statement to the press 
4716,"outside the courthouse the next day, St. Clair hinted that no more "
4717,"evidence would be forthcoming. Hoping to clarify the situation, "
4718,Jaworski wrote to St. Clair on February 1 asking whether it was then 
4719,clear that the White House would not voluntarily produce any addi- 
4720,"tional evidence. Three days later, St. Clair responded: it was the "
4721,President’s view that he had furnished sufficient evidence to determine 
4722,whether there was probable cause for returning indictments and that 
4723,further production would only delay the investigations. He voiced the 
4724,hope that some alternative means of furnishing needed information 
4725,could be agreed upon to avoid “prolonged litigation.” At the same 
4726,"time, St. Clair indicated that he would have to review the requests "
4727,for documents and that he would respond as soon as possible. 
4728,White House attention was then focused solefy on the impeach- 
4729,ment inquiry. Perhaps one of the most troubling points for the Special 
4730,"Prosecutor was the Administration’s concerted attack on John Dean, "
4731,an important witness in the Watergate investigation. In response to 
4732,"this attack, wherein Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott and others "
4733,"had issued statements demeaning Dean’s credibility, on February 3 "
4734,Jaworski publicly stated his belief in Dean’s veracity. Three days 
4735,earlier WSPF had found it necessary to vouch for Dean’s credibility 
4736,"in a court proceeding. On February 4, the day that St. Clair indicated "
4737,that no more tapes would be made available to the Special Prosecutor 
4738,(tapes obviously critical to determining whether or not John Dean 
4739,"8 These included: the January 9 request for tapes related to Watergate, the "
4740,November 2 and December 3 requests for documents relating to the ** Townhouse ’ f 
4741,"operation, the December 3 request for records relating to the appointments of "
4742,"ambassadors, the August 27 request for records relating to the wiretap of Joseph "
4743,"Kraft, the December 18 request for Fred Fielding’s records relating to IRS, the "
4744,"December 4 request for documents relating to ITT, the January 8 request for "
4745,"documents relating to the dairy industry, and the October 10 request for docu- "
4746,"ments relating to the May 3, 1972 assault on demonstrators. "
4747,105
4748,"was telling the full truth), the White House press office released the "
4749,following statement in St. Clair's name: 
4750,I have noted that the Special Prosecutor and members of his 
4751,staff have seen fit to discuss in public their views regarding John 
4752,"Dean's veracity. I can say categorically, however, that the tapes "
4753,and other evidence furnished to the Special Prosecutor — at least 
4754,as far as the President is concerned— do not support sworn state- 
4755,ments before the Senate Select Committee made by Mr. Dean 
4756,"as to what the President knew about Watergate, and especially "
4757,when he knew it. The evidence does support what the President 
4758,has said on this matter. 
4759,"I do not intend, nor would it be appropriate for me, to discuss "
4760,"the technical, legal issues of perjury. I suggest the time and place "
4761,"for discussing such matters is in court, or perhaps before the House "
4762,"Judiciary Committee, not in the public media. For this reason, T "
4763,do not believe it would be appropriate to further discuss this 
4764,matter at this time. 
4765,"On February 8, Jaworski met with St. Clair to discuss the Presi- "
4766,dent's refusal to provide additional tapes. If the President supplied 
4767,"the tapes alread}^ requested for the Watergate grand jury investigation, "
4768,"St. Clair asked, would the Special Prosecutor agree not to request any "
4769,further tapes in connection with that investigation? Jaworski 
4770,responded in writing that he would be willing to forego future requests 
4771,"for the grand jury investigation, if it was understood that “this agree- "
4772,ment would not foreclose further requests that may be occasioned 
4773,by legitimate defense demands or our trial preparation needs after 
4774,"indictment."" "
4775,"On February 13, St. Clair responded that the President had "
4776,"refused to reconsider his earlier decision to end his cooperation, at "
4777,least with regard to producing any tape recordings of Presidential 
4778,conversations. It was clear to Jaworski that any voluntary coopera- 
4779,"tion was at an end, and, in accordance with his obligation to report "
4780,to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the status of requests to the 
4781,"White House for evidence, he wrote to Senator Eastland to outline "
4782,the correspondence of the first week of February and summarize the 
4783,materials provided and refused by the White House from the beginning 
4784,of the Special Prosecutor's office to date. Jaworski added: 
4785,Although it is true that the grand jury will be able to return 
4786,"indictments without the benefit of this material, the material is "
4787,important to a complete and thorough investigation and may 
4788,contain evidence necessary for any future trials. 
4789,"At the same time, the Special Prosecutor decided that prolonged "
4790,litigation to obtain more tapes for the grand jury would unduly 
4791,"delay the Watergate indictment. Accordingly, at his recommendation, "
4792,106
4793,the grand jury returned an indictment on March 1 in United States v. 
4794,"Mitchell , the Watergate cover-up case. 9 "
4795,"Other grand jury investigations were also pending, and President "
4796,Nixon also refused to turn over any documents or tapes for them. 
4797,"On February 27, St. Clair wrote that because the President believed "
4798,"that the grand juries had sufficient evidence, he would not consent "
4799,"to provide any materials relating to “Townhouse,” appointment of "
4800,"ambassadors, White House contacts with IRS, ITT, or the May 3 "
4801,"incident. As to “Townhouse,” St. Clair also challenged the Special "
4802,Prosecutor’s jurisdiction because the investigations involved the 
4803,1970 congressional elections. Jaworski responded immediately that 
4804,he could not “imagine” how the White House knows whether the 
4805,grand jury had been “furnished ‘sufficient evidence’ to render fair 
4806,and thorough consideration to the question of returning indictments.” 
4807,He also challenged the assertion that he had no jurisdiction over the 
4808,"“Townhouse” matter. On March 2, St. Clair “withdrew” his letter. "
4809,"Although “Townhouse” documents were produced on March 14, "
4810,it appeared that there would not be any significant voluntary co- 
4811,"operation in other areas. Accordingly, on that day Jaworski issued a "
4812,subpoena on behalf of the grand juiy for documents relating to the 
4813,appointments and campaign contributions of four ambassadors. 
4814,"Shortly after the subpoena was served, St. Clair requested an ad- "
4815,"journment of the return date, and on March 29 the President began "
4816,voluntary compliance. 
4817,"At about the same time, the President produced a short portion "
4818,of the recording of a meeting for use in former White House aide 
4819,"Dwight Chapin’s perjury trial, but significant voluntary cooperation "
4820,with WSPF then ceased. The President refused to permit the office 
4821,to review the files of his former assistants Ehrlichman and Colson in 
4822,"connection with the upcoming Fielding break-in trial. 10 Furthermore, "
4823,despite an assurance on April 4 that the office would receive a prompt 
4824,response to a modified and narrower request for tapes and documents 
4825,"relating to the dairy industry investigation, no response was forth- "
4826,"coming. Indeed, it was not until late June that St. Clair informed "
4827,WSPF that no tapes would be provided. 
4828,"9 Prior to ending its investigation, the grand jury invited President Nixon to "
4829,"testify. The President refused, on the grounds that it would be inappropriate for "
4830,a President in light of the constitutional separation of powers to subject himself 
4831,to questioning before the grand jury. 
4832,"10 Later, when the White House refused to permit Ehrlichman access to the "
4833,"materials and a dismissal of the indictment was threatened, the White House "
4834,modified its position to accommodate the minimum requirements set by the 
4835,trial judge. 
4836,107
4837,The Watergate Trial Subpoena Duces Tecum 
4838,"On March 12, Jaworski wrote to St. Clair requesting access to "
4839,recordings believed important to preparation for the Watergate cover- 
4840,up trial. Jaworski requested a response no later than March 19 so that 
4841,any litigation necessary could be initiated promptly in order to avoid 
4842,"any delay in the scheduled trial date of September 9. On March 22, "
4843,St. Clair responded that the request was under “active consideration.” 
4844,He added that the White House had received a similar request from 
4845,"the House Committee on the Judicial, “the resolution of which will "
4846,obviously bear on your request.” During several meetings and tele- 
4847,"phone conversations with St. Clair over the following days, it became "
4848,clear that WSPF would receive only those materials that were to be 
4849,"made available to the House Committee. 11 According to St. Clair, "
4850,the President would not consider other requests until he had decided 
4851,"what to provide to the Committee. Moreover, St. Clair would not "
4852,specify what criteria would govern the President’s response. 
4853,"Thereafter, on April 11, Jaworski wrote to St. Clair to inform him "
4854,"that he would seek a trial subpoena on April 16. In response, St. "
4855,Clair withdrew from earlier oral statements to Jaworski and wrote 
4856,that the Office’s requests were not tied in the White House’s view to 
4857,those of the House Committee “other than in the practical sense that 
4858,it is more expeditious to furnish the same material to you and to the 
4859,House Committee at the same time.” As to the criteria that would 
4860,"govern the President’s response, he stated that the response would "
4861,depend upon the evidence necessary to a successful prosecution. The 
4862,"President, he said, would have to balance this need against the public "
4863,"interest, having in mind the Court of Appeals’ statement in Nixon v. "
4864,Sirica that wholesale public access to executive deliberations would 
4865,cripple the executive branch. St. Clair also noted that because the 
4866,"grand jury had returned an indictment, he presumed there already "
4867,"was sufficient evidence to convict each of the defendants. Finally, "
4868,he added that he was “somewhat at a loss to understand how you are 
4869,in a position to assert that you need the materials requested since 
4870,you do not know what is contained in the recordings in question.” 
4871,"On April 16, the Special Prosecutor filed a motion before Judge "
4872,Sirica requesting that he issue a trial subpoena to the President for 
4873,"recordings of 64 specified conversations, stating that production was "
4874,sought before trial in order to permit review and transcription of the 
4875,recordings without necessitating a delay in the trial. The 64 recordings 
4876,had been chosen by reviewing all the evidence then available to the 
4877,Special Prosecutor including those conversations which could be 
4878,11 At the hearing before Judge Sirica on whether the Watergate grand jury- 
4879,report on President Nixon would be transmitted to the House Judiciary Com- 
4880,"mittee, St. Clair had informed the Court that the President would make available "
4881,to the House all materials that had been provided to the Special Prosecutor. 
4882,108
4883,"specifically identified and which, because of either circumstantial "
4884,"evidence or available testimony, 12 the office had reason to believe "
4885,"would be relevant to proving the cover-up conspiracy. In addition, "
4886,because the prosecutors knew they must counter the argument 
4887,that the need for the recordings did not outweigh the interest in 
4888,"confidentiality of executive deliberations, they chose only those "
4889,conversations that were “demonstrably important” to defining the 
4890,"extent of the conspiracy in terms of time, membership and objectives. "
4891,"Judge Sirica issued the subpoena on April 18. On May 2, the return "
4892,"date, the President filed a special appearance and a motion to quash "
4893,the subpoena. Although the President claimed no privilege with 
4894,respect to the Watergate-related portions of the conversations for 
4895,which he had provided transcripts to the House Judiciary Committee 
4896,"on April 30, he claimed executive privilege with respect to the remain- "
4897,"ing materials. 13 In his supporting memorandum, the President argued "
4898,first that the Special Prosecutor had not made a sufficient showing 
4899,"that the items were relevant. Indeed, he argued that because the "
4900,"Special Prosecutor could not show exactly what was in the recordings, "
4901,"he could not establish their relevance to the trial. Next, the President "
4902,contended that the Special Prosecutor's showing of need was insuffi- 
4903,cient. The President claimed that the need for evidence by a grand 
4904,jury is much greater than that of a prosecutor in a post-indictment 
4905,setting. Because the Special Prosecutor had sufficient evidence to 
4906,"make a prima facie showing of guilt against the persons indicted, "
4907,"the President argued, the items sought by the subpoena at best could "
4908,be classified as “merely cumulative or corroborative — certainly not 
4909,"vital or particularly necessary.” The President did indicate, however, "
4910,that if any defendant could show that particular items were excul- 
4911,"patory as to him, the President would consider producing them. "
4912,WSPF knew that its legal position would be strongest if the Special 
4913,Prosecutor disclosed to the Court that the grand jury had voted to 
4914,authorize the Special Prosecutor to name President Nixon as an 
4915,unindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate trial. The grand jury's 
4916,finding was important because it formed a factual predicate for the 
4917,legal argument that executive privilege did not apply to any conversa- 
4918,tions that occurred in the course of and in furtherance of a criminal 
4919,conspiracy. The office believed that the public purpose underlying ex- 
4920,ecutive privilege — to promote bona fide governmental deliberations — 
4921,could not support the shielding of alleged criminality. Disclosure of 
4922,"12 In some cases, there was testimony either before the grand jury or in other "
4923,forums indicating that the conversation in question related to Watergate. In 
4924,"other cases, the Special Prosecutor judged from events either before or after the "
4925,conversation in question that the conversation probabty concerned Watergate. 
4926,"13 On April 30, the President submitted to the House Judiciary Committee "
4927,transcripts of 43 Watergate-related conversations. 
4928,109
4929,591-439 0 - 75 -8 
4930,"the grand jury’s finding was obviously a sensitive and grave matter, "
4931,and Jaworski believed that he should advise St. Clair and Haig that 
4932,such a disclosure would be made in the event of further proceedings 
4933,"to enforce the subpoena. On Sunday, May 5, Jaworski informed "
4934,them of the grand jury’s finding and stated that unless there were 
4935,"voluntary compliance with the subpoena, at least with respect to 16 "
4936,"conversations regarded as essential to the prosecution, he would make "
4937,the necessary use of the grand jury’s finding to present the best legal 
4938,arguments against the President’s motion to quash. Haig and St. 
4939,Clair asked for additional time to consider the matter before the 
4940,Special Prosecutor filed his response to the motion. 
4941,After listening to the conversations that Jaworski had identified 
4942,"as crucial, including meetings with Haldeman on June 23, 1972, the "
4943,President decided not to comply in any respect with the subpoena. 
4944,"Accordingly, on May 6, the Special Prosecutor filed his response with "
4945,"the District Court. At the suggestion of the Special Prosecutor, the "
4946,"response, which included a statement of the grand jury’s finding, "
4947,"was filed under seal, since Jaworski believed that in light of the pending "
4948,"impeachment inquiry, it would be extremely unfair to have the grand "
4949,"jury’s finding made public at that time, unless that was necessary to "
4950,"the litigation. In addition to his legal memorandum, the Special "
4951,Prosecutor filed a 49-page appendix detailing the relevance of each 
4952,subpoenaed conversation. He argued that the available testimony 
4953,"about the conversations, as well as the circumstances surrounding "
4954,"each conversation, clearly supported a finding that each would be "
4955,relevant to the trial and that the Court should not require a greater 
4956,showing of relevance where the prosecutor in fact did not have access 
4957,to the actual evidence. He then argued that no executive privilege was 
4958,available because each of the participants in the conversation was a 
4959,co-conspirator and each conversation occurred in the course of the 
4960,"conspiracy. Alternatively, he claimed that the need for the evidence, "
4961,which related to aspects of the conspiracy for which no other reliable 
4962,"evidence was available, outweighed any interest in secrecy. The "
4963,Special Prosecutor urged that the need for the evidence was even 
4964,greater now than in the grand jury because the Government has at 
4965,trial the burden of showing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
4966,"Finally, in addition to arguing that the numerous disclosures by "
4967,"the President about Watergate, including the transcripts provided "
4968,"to the House Judiciary Committee on April 30, waived any claim of "
4969,"executive privilege, the Special Prosecutor argued that it was essential "
4970,to obtain the actual tapes of the conversations. Transcripts of the 
4971,conversations would not suffice. To support this point he compared 
4972,some of the transcripts submitted by the White House with those 
4973,prepared by the WSPF for the grand jury. That comparison indicated 
4974,material differences between the two sets of transcripts. Important 
4975,no 
4976,portions had been deleted or marked as unintelligible in the White 
4977,House transcripts. 
4978,"In reply, the President filed a motion to expunge the grand jury’s "
4979,finding. He argued that the grand jury had no jurisdiction over the 
4980,President — that the President could be subject only to impeachment 
4981,for alleged wrongdoing and not to the criminal jurisdiction of the 
4982,courts. The President for the first time also raised the argument 
4983,that the court did not have jurisdiction over the dispute because it 
4984,was “entirely intra-executive in nature.” 
4985,The Special Prosecutor in turn filed a memorandum urging that 
4986,while it was not necessary for the court to decide the difficult issue 
4987,"whether the grand jury could have indicted President Nixon, there Avas "
4988,no question that the grand jury could find that the President was an 
4989,unindicted co-conspirator. Noting that the Constitution did not confer 
4990,"any immunity on the President, the Special Prosecutor argued that, "
4991,because the mere naming of the President as a co-conspirator does not 
4992,have any practical consequences on the President’s ability to perform 
4993,"his constitutional duties, the grand jury’s finding did not violate the "
4994,"separation of powers doctrine. As to the issue of' jurisdiction, he "
4995,"argued that there was in fact a case or controversy because, under "
4996,the WSPF regulations that were binding upon the Department of 
4997,"Justice and the President, the Special Prosecutor had exclusive juris- "
4998,diction for conducting the prosecution of the Watergate case and 
4999,was not subject to the direction of the President or Attorney General. 
5000,"Thus, the Special Prosecutor was not for these purposes a “subordi- "
5001,nate” of the President. Jaworski emphasized that when he had been 
5002,"selected as Special Prosecutor, he had received repeated assurances "
5003,"from Bork, Saxbe, and Haig that his independence would not be inter- "
5004,"fered with. Finally, the Special Prosecutor urged the court to make "
5005,all the proceedings public in view~ of the attack on his authority to seek 
5006,and enforce the subpoena for Presidential conversations. 
5007,Judge Sirica issued his opinion and order enforcing the subpoena 
5008,"on May 20. At the outset, he held that as long as the regulations "
5009,"establishing the independence of the Special Prosecutor were in effect, "
5010,the President’s “attempt to abridge the Special Prosecutor’s independ- 
5011,ence with the argument that he cannot seek evidence from the Presi- 
5012,dent by court process is a nullity and does not defeat the court’s 
5013,jurisdiction.” Accepting WSPF’s showing of relevance and admissi- 
5014,"bility, the court held that the demonstration of need was ( Sufficiently "
5015,compelling to warrant judicial examination in chambers incident to 
5016,weighing claims of privilege where the privilege has not been relin- 
5017,"quished.” Finally, as to the President’s motion to expunge the grand "
5018,"jury’s finding, Judge Sirica stated that he saw no need “to grant more "
5019,extensive protective orders at this time or to expunge portions of the 
5020,"record. Matters sought to be expunged are relevant, for example, "
5021,to a determination that the presumption of privilege is overcome.” 
5022,Ill 
5023,Judge Sirica ordered the President to submit the recordings to the 
5024,court on or before May 31 but stayed his order until May 24 to permit 
5025,the President to seek appellate review. 
5026,"On May 24, the President sought review in the Court of Appeals. "
5027,"That same day, however, the Special Prosecutor fTed a petition in "
5028,the Supreme Court for direct review of Judge Sirica’s order. Under 
5029,"Supreme Court rules, this procedure, which allows the Supreme "
5030,"Court to review a case before it is decided by the Court of Appeals, "
5031,is reserved for cases of imperative public importance. As the Special 
5032,"Prosecutor represented in the petition, expedited consideration by "
5033,the Supreme Court was important to permit the Watergate trial to 
5034,proceed as quickly as poss ble. He estimated that if the Supreme 
5035,"Court were to wait until its October 1974 Term, there would be a "
5036,"delay of at least six months in the start of the trial. Moreover, he "
5037,"submitted that there was little need for a Court of Appeals decision, "
5038,since that Court had considered the same constitutional issues in 
5039,deciding the validity of the grand jury subpoena in Nixon v. Sirica 
5040,the preceding October. The Special Prosecutor’s petition presented 
5041,five issues for review by the Court: 
5042,1. Whether the President is subject to a judicial order directing 
5043,compliance with the subpoena duces tecum issued on the application 
5044,of the Special Prosecutor in the name of the United States. 
5045,2. Whether a federal court is bound by the assertion by the 
5046,President of an absolute “executive privilege” to withhold demon- 
5047,strably material evidence from the trial of charges of obstruction 
5048,of justice by his own White House aides and party leaders upon 
5049,the grounds that he deems production to be against the public 
5050,interest. 
5051,3. Whether a claim of executive privilege based on the gen- 
5052,eralized interest in the confidentiality of government deliberations 
5053,can block the prosecution’s access to evidence material to the trial 
5054,of charges of criminal misconduct by high government officials 
5055,"who participated in those deliberations, particularly where there "
5056,is a prima jfacie showing that the deliberations occurred in the 
5057,course of the criminal conspiracy charged in the indictment. 
5058,4. Whether any executive privilege that otherwise might have 
5059,been applicable to discussions in the offices of the President con- 
5060,cerning Watergate had been waived. 
5061,5. Whether the Special Prosecutor had made an adequate 
5062,showing as to the relevance and admissibility of the subpoenaed 
5063,items. 
5064,The President opposed the petition of the Special Prosecutor solely 
5065,on the ground that it was important for the Supreme Court to consider 
5066,the case only after careful reflection and deliberation and with the 
5067,aid of decisions by the lower courts. The President also stated that 
5068,“it is at least questionable whether it is in the best interests of all 
5069,parties involved to rush to judgment in this case in the midst of an 
5070,impeachment inquiry involving intrinsically related matters.” 
5071,112
5072,On May 31 the Supreme Court granted the Special Prosecutor’s 
5073,petition and directed the parties to file their briefs simultaneously on 
5074,"June 21. Reply briefs would be filed on July 1, and oral argument was "
5075,set for July 8. 
5076,"After the Supreme Court granted the Special Prosecutor’s petition, "
5077,the President filed a cross-petition raising the sole question whether 
5078,the grand jury has the authority to charge an incumbent President 
5079,as an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal proceeding. 14 The 
5080,"Supreme Court granted the cross-petition on June 15, setting the "
5081,same briefing and argument schedule as for the petition of the Special 
5082,Prosecutor. 
5083,The brief for the Special Prosecutor basically presented the same 
5084,arguments previously outlined in the District Court and in the previous 
5085,October’s Court of Appeals case. The only new areas involved the 
5086,questions whether the Court had jurisdiction over the dispute between 
5087,the President and the Special Prosecutor and whether the grand jury 
5088,had the power to name the President as an unindicted co-conspirator. 
5089,The Special Prosecutor initially was undecided about addressing the 
5090,question of jurisdiction in his brief because it had not been presented 
5091,by the petition of either party. Since the issue of the Court’s jurisdic- 
5092,"tion, however, can be raised at any time in any judicial proceeding, "
5093,"he determined to brief the issue fully at the outset, instead of waiting "
5094,to reply to any argument by the President that the Court lacked 
5095,jurisdiction. 15 As for the second issue — whether the President was 
5096,subject to being named an unindicted co-conspirator — it was decided 
5097,as a matter of strategy to treat the question only briefly in a long 
5098,footnote to the argument that there can be no privilege when there is 
5099,a showing that the subpoenaed conversations occurred in the course 
5100,of a criminal conspiracy. The full development of the argument that 
5101,the President is subject to being named a co-conspirator was left to 
5102,the reply brief. 
5103,"The President’s brief, in addition to presenting the arguments "
5104,"made in the District Court, claimed that the President’s absolute "
5105,prerogative to withhold the tapes from the courts rested in the con- 
5106,"stitutional right of privacy and freedom of expression, as well as the "
5107,separation of powers. The President also argued that the Court could 
5108,not ignore the pending impeachment inquiry and that enforcement of 
5109,the subpoena would thrust the courts — unconstitutionally — into that 
5110,controversy. 
5111,"14 On June 15 the Court, on the joint motion of the Special Prosecutor and "
5112,"counsel for the President, unsealed the grand jurjr’s finding. "
5113,15 This decision was influenced by the exchange of correspondence among 
5114,"Jaworski, St. Clair and Saxbe in which Jaworski charged that the President’s "
5115,challenge to Jaworski’s jurisdiction violated the assurances of independence 
5116,that he had received when he was appointed. 
5117,113
5118,"Following oral argument, the Supreme Court on July 24 affirmed "
5119,"Judge Sirica's order enforcing the trial subpoena. 16 First, the Court "
5120,held that it had jurisdiction in the dispute between the President and 
5121,the Special Prosecutor because the regulations establishing WSPF 
5122,were binding on the executive branch and guaranteed the Special 
5123,Prosecutor's independence from control by the Attorney General and 
5124,"the President. According to the Court, the dispute, stemming from "
5125,the claim of privilege in the face of a judicial demand for evidence 
5126,"relevant and admissible in a criminal case, was the type of dispute "
5127,traditionally adjudicated by the courts. The Court then held that 
5128,under the Constitution the courts ultimately must determine what the 
5129,constitutional powers of each branch are and the courts have the 
5130,ultimate power to decide whether a claim of privilege is well taken in 
5131,a judicial proceeding. The Court then rejected the claim of an absolute 
5132,"executive privilege, holding that although the privilege is constitu- "
5133,tionally based (the first time this had been decided firmly by the 
5134,"Supreme Court), it is subject to a balance. "
5135,We conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as 
5136,to subpoenaed material sought for use in a criminal trial is based 
5137,"only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot pre- "
5138,vail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the 
5139,fair administration of criminal justice. The generalized assertion 
5140,"of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for "
5141,evidence in a pending criminal trial. 
5142,"Finally, the Court held that Judge Sirica had acted within his dis- "
5143,cretion in finding that the Special Prosecutor's showing had satisfied 
5144,the burden required for the issuance of a trial subpoena. 
5145,The Court did not reach the issue raised by the President in his 
5146,cross-petition — whether a President is subject to being named as 
5147,an unindicted co-conspirator by the grand jury. Because the Court 
5148,found that the interest in confidential^ did not prevail over the 
5149,"need for evidence in a criminal prosecution, it was unnecessary for "
5150,the Court to decide whether the privilege also was vitiated because 
5151,the conversations occurred in the course of a criminal conspiracy. 
5152,"Accordingly, the Court dismissed the cross-petition as “improvidently "
5153,"granted."" "
5154,"The day the Supreme Court's opinion was filed, the President "
5155,announced that he would comply. The next day the Special Prosecutor 
5156,filed a motion before Judge Sirica for an order implementing com- 
5157,"pliance with the judge's earlier order of May 20, enforcing the sub- "
5158,"poena. Less than a week later, St. Clair produced the first set of "
5159,16 The decision was unanimous with one Justice having disqualified himself. 
5160,114
5161,"subpoenaed recordings for court review. 17 Then, on August 5, before "
5162,"he was required to produce them in court, the President publicly "
5163,"disclosed the transcripts of his conversations of June 23, 1972. These "
5164,"transcripts showed his early involvement in the cover-up, and belied "
5165,contrary claims he had repeatedly made to the public and to the 
5166,Congress. His remaining support against impeachment in the House 
5167,and conviction in the Senate quickly eroded. Four days later he 
5168,resigned. 
5169,Po st-Resignation Access to the Nixon Administration Materials 
5170,"A few hours before the President announced his resignation, Haig "
5171,conferred briefly with Jaworski to tell him of the imminent announce- 
5172,ment and of plans to move the Nixon Administration materials to San 
5173,"Clemente. He assured Jaworski, however, that the materials would be "
5174,kept intact and that there would be a lawyer to respond to any re- 
5175,quests that WSPF might have. WSPF had numerous requests out- 
5176,standing and there had not been full compliance with the trial 
5177,subpoena. 18 
5178,"On August 13, representatives of the Special Prosecutor met with "
5179,Buzhardt and St. Clair about the status of the Nixon materials. 
5180,Buzhardt said that the Special Prosecutor would be notified before 
5181,"any steps were taken to move the materials to San Clemente, but "
5182,later that day the office learned through the wire services that there 
5183,were immediate plans to move the materials to San Clemente. The 
5184,reports indicated that a van was being loaded with the former Presi- 
5185,dent’s personal files. White House press statements also claimed that 
5186,the Special Prosecutor had approved the transfer. WSPF immediately 
5187,telephoned the White House to object to the removal and the state- 
5188,"ment. The statement was retracted, and Buzhardt gave an assurance "
5189,that there would be no transfer without adequate advance notice to 
5190,enable the Special Prosecutor to take legal action. 
5191,On August 15 four members of the Special Prosecutor’s staff met 
5192,"with Buzhardt and Philip W. Buchen, who that day had been named "
5193,"counsel to President Ford. At the outset, the WSPF representatives "
5194,17 Under procedures first set forth in Nixon v. Sirica and incorporated in 
5195,"Judge Sirica’s order of May 20, all subpoenaed recordings (with the exception "
5196,of those conversations that had not been recorded) were produced for inspection 
5197,"by the judge. After reviewing the recordings, all relevant portions were released "
5198,to WSPF for use in the cover-up trial. Under the Supreme Court’s decision in 
5199,United States v. Nixon } all portions of the subpoenaed recordings not actually 
5200,relevant to the trial remained privileged. 
5201,"18 Although all of the tapes called for by the subpoena had been produced, "
5202,very few of the written notes and other materials pertaining to the subpoenaed 
5203,conversations (materials that the subpoena required to be produced) were pro- 
5204,vided to the court. 
5205,115
5206,"delivered a schedule summarizing all requests then outstanding, as "
5207,well as schedules delineating possible future requests for files that the 
5208,Special Prosecutor believed contained evidence relevant to his con- 
5209,tinuing investigations. The staff members stated their preference not 
5210,"to enter into a detailed discussion of ownership of the materials, but "
5211,observed that there were strong arguments that the working papers of 
5212,"one Administration, as long as they are relevant to pending business "
5213,"of the next Administration, must be made available to the next "
5214,"Administration. At the same time, they emphasized their interest in "
5215,reaching an amicable arrangement with former President Nixon and 
5216,the Ford Administration. Buzhardt expressly assured them that 
5217,nothing would be moved as long as the Special Prosecutor objected. 
5218,Buzhardt further stated that he would visit the former President the 
5219,following week to impress upon him the urgency of securing a repre- 
5220,sentative to enter into discussions with WSPF to explore possible 
5221,means of providing WSPF with access to the materials it needed to 
5222,"complete its investigations. At the conclusion of the meeting, it was "
5223,announced by joint agreement that the status of the materials in 
5224,which the Special Prosecutor had a continuing interest would be 
5225,maintained pending discussions. 
5226,"Following the meeting, Buchen requested the Attorney General "
5227,to prepare an opinion on the question of ownership of the Nixon 
5228,materials. Upon receiving informal advice from the Department of 
5229,"Justice that the former President owned the materials, Buchen, on "
5230,"behalf of President Ford, without any notice to WSPF, entered into "
5231,"discussions with Herbert J. Miller, Jr., counsel to the former President, "
5232,concerning a depository agreement regarding future custody of the 
5233,Nixon tapes and documents. 
5234,"On September 8, President Ford announced that he had granted a "
5235,full and unconditional pardon to his predecessor for any offenses he 
5236,might have committed during his tenure as President. At the same 
5237,"time, President Ford made public a September 7 agreement between "
5238,"Arthur F. Sampson, the Administrator of General Services, and former "
5239,President Nixon whereby all “historical materials” of the Nixon Ad- 
5240,ministration would be deposited in a secure federal facility in Cali- 
5241,"fornia. Under the terms of the agreement, once the materials were "
5242,"deposited, all requests or subpoenas for the materials would have to "
5243,be directed to the former President who would have sole control over 
5244,who could gain access to them. President Ford also announced the 
5245,Attorney General’s formal opinion that former President Nixon 
5246,owned all the materials in question. 
5247,On September 12 members of the Special Prosecutor’s staff met 
5248,with Buchen and representatives of the Department of Justice. The 
5249,WSPF representatives stated their belief that the Nixon-Sampson 
5250,agreement violated the assurances given to the Special Prosecutor on 
5251,"August 15. The Special Prosecutor was willing, if necessary, to chal- "
5252,116
5253,"lenge the validity of the agreement. As a result, the Justice Department "
5254,undertook discussions with Miller to determine whether a “modifi- 
5255,cation” of the agreement could be reached to accommodate the in- 
5256,terests of the Special Prosecutor. 
5257,Over the following days there were a series of meetings between 
5258,Miller and the Department on the one hand and the Department and 
5259,WSPF on the other. 
5260,The discussions included a proposal that the Special Prosecutor’s 
5261,requests for Nixon materials be submitted to an arbitration panel 
5262,"composed of a designee of the former President, a designee of the "
5263,"Special Prosecutor, and a third person to be chosen by the other two "
5264,"members of the panel. In making decisions, the arbitration panel "
5265,would apply the same standards and principles that would be appli- 
5266,cable in a court of competent jurisdiction. Negotiations over the 
5267,details of a possible agreement also were carriedmn directly between 
5268,Miller and representatives of the Special Prosecutor. They eventually 
5269,"broke down, however, over two principal issues — whether there would "
5270,be any judicial review of the arbitration panel’s decisions and whether 
5271,the arbitration agreement would make any statement regarding the 
5272,legislation then pending in the Congress to abrogate the Nixon-Samp- 
5273,son agreement. During these negotiations former President Nixon 
5274,voluntarily provided materials that WSPF requested for the Watergate 
5275,cover-up trial. 
5276,On October 17 former President Nixon brought suit in the United 
5277,"States District Court for the District of Columbia against Sampson, "
5278,"Buchen and H. Stuart Knight, the Director of the Secret Service "
5279,"(the custodian of many of the Nixon materials), to compel enforce- "
5280,"ment of the September 7 agreement or, in the alternative, to require "
5281,delivery of all the tapes and documents to him in California. The 
5282,Special Prosecutor intervened in this suit to protect and preserve 
5283,his interests in the Presidential materials. A temporary restraining 
5284,order by the court maintained the status quo and permitted access 
5285,to the materials only with the joint consent of the former President 
5286,and counsel for President Ford. 
5287,"Thereafter, the Special Prosecutor issued grand jury subpoenas "
5288,to Buchen for Nixon materials which the office believed to be relevant 
5289,"and important to its pending investigations. On November 9, following "
5290,"discussions among counsel for President Ford, the Department of "
5291,"Justice and the Special Prosecutor, the President determined that "
5292,“the due administration of justice and the public interest require 
5293,that the Special Prosecutor have prompt and effective use of those 
5294,Presidential materials of the Nixon Administration now located in 
5295,the White House complex that are relevant and important to ongoing 
5296,criminal investigations and prosecutions within the Special Prose- 
5297,cutor’s jurisdiction.” The Special Prosecutor then entered into an 
5298,"agreement with Buchen, Sampson and Knight whereby WSPF would "
5299,117
5300,gain access to the materials to conduct a limited search for the relevant 
5301,documents and tapes. The subpoenas issued to Buchen were then 
5302,withdrawn. 
5303,"Because of the outstanding temporary restraining order, it was "
5304,necessary for the Special Prosecutor and the Department of Justice 
5305,to apply to the court for a modification of the terms of the order to 
5306,permit implementation of the November 9 agreement. Former 
5307,"President Nixon, of course, opposed the modification. The Special "
5308,Prosecutor argued to the court that even if the former President were 
5309,"the owner of the materials, the current Administration had a right "
5310,to use them in conducting important ongoing governmental business 
5311,and that the former President had no right to assert executive privilege 
5312,to prevent access to such use. In seeking this modification the Special 
5313,Prosecutor hoped that the Court would be convinced to separate a 
5314,prosecutor’s interests from that of others seeking access to the mate- 
5315,rials and to meet the need for an expeditious ruling on the request. 
5316,These hopes were not realized. The Court continued to defer 
5317,action on this request until it determined the entire matter relating to 
5318,all claimants. The motion to amend the temporary restraining order 
5319,"was not granted immediately and, it appeared that there might be "
5320,extended litigation before the November 9 agreement could be carried 
5321,"out. Accordingly, the Special Prosecutor resumed negotiations with "
5322,Miller in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable agreement to afford 
5323,the Special Prosecutor use of the limited number of materials that 
5324,were relevant to his investigations. These negotiations lasted for 
5325,approximately six weeks and included numerous meetings. Each side 
5326,"drafted various proposals which were debated at length. Basically, "
5327,"under the agreement as finally proposed, however, the Special Prose- "
5328,cutor would make requests similar to those he would have made under 
5329,"the November 9 agreement. Miller, however, would review all re- "
5330,"quested recordings as well as his client’s personal files, while WSPF "
5331,would review the files of White House staff members. The Special 
5332,Prosecutor would have the right of access to all materials pertinent 
5333,to the investigations designated in his requests that were located 
5334,"during these reviews. In the end, however, this phase of the negotia- "
5335,"tions failed to produce agreement. It became apparent that Miller, "
5336,either through insertion of specific language he wanted in the agree- 
5337,"ment or merely by its timing, could use such an agreement as leverage "
5338,to attempt to prevent the then pending Presidential Recordings and 
5339,Materials Preservation Act from becoming law. The Special Prose- 
5340,cutor determined that it would be inappropriate to allow his office to 
5341,be placed in the posture of signing an agreement which could jeopardize 
5342,the chances that the bill would become law. 
5343,"The Act as signed into law on December 19 did not make it possible, "
5344,"however, for the Special Prosecutor to gain access to the materials "
5345,"he sought without extended litigation. Indeed, on December 20 "
5346,118
5347,former President Nixon filed an action challenging the constitu- 
5348,"tionality of the Act. WSPF and Miller then reopened negotiations, "
5349,which resulted in an informal understanding that was implemented 
5350,"between late February and July, 1975. Under this agreement indices "
5351,of portions of the Nixon materials identified by the Special Prosecutor 
5352,"were prepared by professional archivists. The Special Prosecutor, using "
5353,"these various indices, designated files to be searched for materials "
5354,pertinent to investigations. He further described the investigations 
5355,to allow the person examining the files to determine which documents 
5356,were in fact pertinent to the specified investigations. With a limited 
5357,number of exceptions — those files that contained highly personal or 
5358,confidential communications of former President Nixon — the file 
5359,searches were conducted by archivists assigned to White House coun- 
5360,sel^ office. All documents located in any file reviewed that were relevant 
5361,to any of the specified investigations were supplied to WSPF. It was 
5362,"agreed, however, that notes of Haldeman and Ehrlichman meetings "
5363,with the President would be turned over only if they pertained to the 
5364,specific investigation designated for the file in which they were found. 
5365,"Furthermore, all requested recordings were reviewed by Miller or an "
5366,"associate, and if there were any conversations on the recordings with "
5367,"information pertinent to the Special Prosecutor’s investigations, copies "
5368,of those conversations were made available. WSPF was also permitted 
5369,to listen to any recording if there was any question as to its pertinence. 
5370,This procedure provided WSPF with much information needed for 
5371,pending trials and for conclusion of several investigations. 
5372,The final dealings with former President Nixon involved WSPF’s 
5373,"taking of his testimony under oath, in the presence of two grand "
5374,"jurors, in California on -June 23 and 24, 1975. A stipulation filed with "
5375,the court stated that the grand jury believed it was necessary to 
5376,obtain the testimony of the former President concerning several areas 
5377,of ongoing inquiry. Upon his representation that he was willing to 
5378,"submit to questioning, but unwilling to travel to Washington because "
5379,"of his doctor’s advice, and in view of other legal considerations, the "
5380,grand jury consented to a sworn examination in California. This 
5381,procedure was approved by the court and the transcript was later 
5382,presented to the full grand jury and made part of its minutes. 
5383,ACTIONS RELATED TO 
5384,PRESIDENT NIXON'S POSSIBLE CRIMINAL LIABILITY 
5385,Background 
5386,Speculation about the President’s possible involvement in 
5387,"Watergate-related offenses, stemming largely from press reports, pre- "
5388,"dated the appointment of the Special Prosecutor. Later, during "
5389,"televised hearings before the Senate Select Committee, Sen. Howard "
5390,119
5391,"Baker repeatedly expressed this concern by asking ""What did the "
5392,President know and when did he know it?” Responsibility for any 
5393,criminal investigation of this question was given to the Special Prose- 
5394,"cutor. His charter gave ""full authority for investigating and prose- "
5395,cuting . . . allegations involving the President.” 
5396,Direct evidence linking President Nixon to the Watergate cover-up 
5397,"came from former White House counsel John Dean, when he testified "
5398,publicly before the Senate Select Committee in June 1973. Dean told 
5399,the Committee that President Nixon had discussed executive clemency 
5400,for Watergate burglar Howard Hunt with his former aide Charles 
5401,"Colson, and that the President had approved the payment of money "
5402,to Hunt in return for his silence. Dean’s account of two crucial 
5403,meetings with Nixon and of the President’s approval of raising further 
5404,"""hush money” was contradicted by former White House aide H. R. "
5405,"Haldeman, who testified before the Committee that the President had "
5406,"told Dean with respect to the money: ""We could do that, but it would "
5407,"be wrong.” In the Summer of 1973, at Cox’s request, WSPF staff "
5408,prepared the same kind of factual memorandum about any possible 
5409,criminal involvement of the President as had been prepared with 
5410,"respect to other major actors. At this stage, the Watergate Task "
5411,Force memorandum relied heavily on Dean’s uncorroborated 
5412,testimony. 
5413,"After the ""Saturday Night Massacre” of October 20, 1973, WSPF "
5414,received seven subpoenaed tape recordings of Presidential conversa- 
5415,"tions which had taken place from September 15, 1972, to April 16, "
5416,"1973. Of particular significance was the tape of the March 21, 1973, "
5417,"morning meeting among the President, Haldeman, and Dean, which "
5418,recorded the following discussion about payments to the Watergate 
5419,burglars : 
5420,President: How much money do you need? 
5421,"Dean: I would say these people are going to cost, ah, a million "
5422,"dollars over the next, ah, few years. "
5423,President: We could get that. 
5424,Dean: Um huh. 
5425,"President: You, on, the money, you need the money. I mean, "
5426,"ah, you can get the money, but its . . . "
5427,Dean: Well I think that we’re . . . 
5428,"President: My point is, you can, you can get a million dollars, "
5429,"and you can get it in cash. Ah, I know where it could be got. "
5430,Dean: Um huh. 
5431,"President: I mean, ah, it’s not easy, but it could be done. "
5432,"But, ah, the question is, who the hell would handle it? "
5433,Dean: That is right. Ah. 
5434,President: Any ideas on that? 
5435,Dean: Well I would think that would be something Mitchell 
5436,ought to be charged with. 
5437,President: I would think so too.

5440,"President : That's right, that's why, that's why your immedi- "
5441,"ate thing, you've got no choice with Hunt with a hundred and "
5442,twenty or whatever it is. Right? 
5443,Dean: That's right. 
5444,President: Would you agree that that's the buy time thing 
5445,and you better damn well get that done. ^ 
5446,Dean: I think that he ought to be given some signal anyway 
5447,"to, to . . . "
5448,"President: . . . Well for Christ's sake get it, in a way that, "
5449,"ah — who, who's gonna talk to him? Colson? He's the one who is "
5450,supposed to know him. 
5451,This tape recording and others received by the Special Prosecutor 
5452,in December substantially corroborated and added significantly to 
5453,"Dean's allegations. In January 1974, and as argued later at the "
5454,"cover-up trial, the Watergate task force concluded that President "
5455,"Nixon had known prior to March 21, 1973, about the existence of a "
5456,conspiracy to obstruct justice on the part of his closest White House 
5457,"aides and high officials of his Re-Election Committee, and that on "
5458,"March 21, when the President learned many of the material details "
5459,"of the cover-up and the potential criminal liability of those involved, "
5460,he had furthered the conspiracy by urging that a cash payment be 
5461,"made to Howard Hunt to “buy time"" and by discussing a possible "
5462,strategy of continuing the cover-up by limited disclosure of some 
5463,information together with continued concealment of the most damag- 
5464,"ing evidence. On receiving this analysis, Special Prosecutor Jaworski "
5465,sought to determine whether an incumbent President could be in- 
5466,dicted for a crime. 
5467,Determining Whether to Seek the President's Indictment 
5468,Counsel to the Special Prosecutor and his staff conducted extensive 
5469,legal research to resolve whether the Constitution contemplated the 
5470,impeachment process as the exclusive means for adjudicating the 
5471,"culpability of an incumbent President. As they found, that issue had "
5472,been largely ignored or only obliquely alluded to at the time of the 
5473,Constitutional Convention and in the ensuing 186 years. 
5474,"The question of the President's indictability, which was viewed "
5475,in the office as obviously momentous in terms of its consequences 
5476,"for the country, resulted in an intense debate among members of "
5477,"the Special Prosecutor's staff. After examining the Constitution, "
5478,"relevant case law, and the historical and contemporary arguments, "
5479,there appeared to be no textual basis in the Constitution for con- 
5480,cluding that an incumbent President — any more than an}^ other 
5481,Federal official subject to the impeachment process — is immune from 
5482,the ordinary process of criminal law prior to impeachment and 
5483,"removal from office. Consequently, one approach was that, if a prima "
5484,facie case of obstruction of justice existed on the basis of known 
5485,121
5486,"evidence, an indictment of the President would be essential to vindi- "
5487,cate the principles that there should be equal justice for all and that 
5488,no one is above the law. This view held that a failure to indict the 
5489,"incumbent President, in the face of evidence of his criminal activity, "
5490,would seriously impair the integrity of the criminal process. Such 
5491,impairment would be all the more severe because the President was 
5492,the very man in whom the Constitution reposes the final obligation 
5493,"to ensure that the law is obeyed and enforced, and because his actions "
5494,appeared to have been designed to place himself and other individuals 
5495,beyond the reach of the law. 
5496,The other approach was that the impeachment process should 
5497,take precedence over a criminal indictment because the Constitution 
5498,was ambivalent on this point and an indictment provoking a neces- 
5499,sarily lengthy legal proceeding would either compel the President's 
5500,resignation or substantially cripple his ability to function effectively 
5501,in the domestic and foreign fields as the Nation's Chief Executive 
5502,"Officer. Those consequences, it was argued, should result from the "
5503,"impeachment mechanism explicitly provided by the Constitution, "
5504,a mechanism in which the elected representatives of the public conduct 
5505,"preliminary inquiries and, in the event of the filing of a bill of impeach- "
5506,"ment of the President, a trial based upon all the facts. Any indictment "
5507,could then be brought after those proceedings were completed. Under 
5508,"this view, a single, unelected prosecutor should be hesitant to invoke "
5509,"the criminal justice system, prior to the completion of pending im- "
5510,"peachment hearings, especially when the constitutionality of such a "
5511,course remained in doubt. There was also concern that an indictment 
5512,of the President would suspend the impeachment proceedings until 
5513,after his criminal trial. 
5514,"The Special Prosecutor concluded that the Supreme Court, if "
5515,"presented with the question, would not uphold an indictment of the "
5516,"President for the crimes of which he would be accused. Accordingly, "
5517,he thought it would not be responsible conduct to recommend that 
5518,"the grand jury return an indictment against the President, partic- "
5519,ularly when the impeachment proceedings were ongoing. Since the 
5520,Special Prosecutor's charter mandated his investigating allegations 
5521,"against the President and authorized reports to the Congress, he then "
5522,examined the legality of a grand jury presentment concerning Presi- 
5523,"dent Nixon, and the possible transmission of evidence pertinent to "
5524,the question of his involvement to the House of Representatives. 
5525,"After additional legal research and deliberation within the office, the "
5526,Special Prosecutor determined that this course of action would be 
5527,both constitutional and appropriate. It was his view that the House 
5528,"of Representatives, in the first instance, was the appropriate body "
5529,"under the Constitution to examine evidence relating to the President, "
5530,and to determine whether he should be charged with conduct justi- 
5531,fying impeachment and removal from office. Many alternatives for 
5532,122
5533,the form of such a report were considered; the possibilities included a 
5534,"presentment detailing all the evidence in narrative form, a conclusory "
5535,"summary of grand jury findings of fact and conclusions of law, or a "
5536,transmission of relevant witness testimony without comment or con- 
5537,clusions. The Special Prosecutor advised the grand jury to submit a 
5538,"report with evidence relating to the President to Judge Sirica, and to "
5539,recommend that the judge transmit such evidence to the House 
5540,Judiciary Committee. 
5541,In order to avoid any claim of unilateral action on the part of the 
5542,Special Prosecutor in the event that he should name the President as 
5543,"a co-conspirator during pre-trial proceedings in the Watergate case, "
5544,Jaworski also sought the grand jury’s judgment on his opinion that 
5545,the President was a member of the charged conspiracy and that 
5546,evidentiary considerations at a cover-up trial mandated naming the 
5547,"President as a participant in the conspiracy. Thus, when the grand "
5548,jury voted to indict seven men in connection with the Watergate 
5549,"cover-up, it also voted to name Richard M. Nixon as one of the 18 "
5550,unindicted co -conspirators in an alleged conspiracy to obstruct 
5551,justice. 
5552,"At the time the grand jury handed up the indictment on March 1, "
5553,it also submitted a Report and Recommendation advising the Chief 
5554,Judge that it “had heard evidence that it regards as having a material 
5555,bearing on matters within the primary jurisdiction” of the House 
5556,"Judiciary Committee in its impeachment inquiry, but that it ought "
5557,“to defer to the House of Representatives” in determining what action 
5558,was warranted by the evidence. The grand jury recommended that 
5559,the sealed materials accompanying the report be transmitted to the 
5560,House Judiciary Committee. The materials included 12 recordings of 
5561,Presidential conversations and testimony pertinent to President 
5562,Nixon’s involvement in the Watergate matter. 
5563,In a March 6 hearing before Judge Sirica on the disposition of the 
5564,"grand jury report, James St. Clair announced for the President that "
5565,he would furnish to the Judiciary Committee all the materials that had 
5566,previously been furnished to the Special Prosecutor’s office. The 
5567,Special Prosecutor’s counsel argued that the materials the White 
5568,House had agreed to supply to the Committee were not necessarily 
5569,the same as those the grand jury asked the court to transmit to the 
5570,"Committee. John Doar and Albert Jenner, appearing on behalf of "
5571,"the Committee, requested that the Court deliver the grand jury "
5572,report to enable the Committee to discharge its constitutional obliga- 
5573,tion with the aid of the best information available. In a March 8 
5574,"letter from Committee Chairman Peter Rodino to Judge Sirica, "
5575,Rodino stated that a unanimous resolution of the Committee reflected 
5576,its view that in constitutional terms it would be unthinkable if the 
5577,material was kept from the House of Representatives. Judge Sirica 
5578,123
5579,ruled on March 18 that the grand jury report and accompanying 
5580,materials should be delivered to the Committee. 
5581,"On March 20, two defendants named in the Watergate cover-up "
5582,"indictment, H. R. Haldeman and Gordon Strachan, filed a petition "
5583,for a writ of mandamus with the Court of Appeals to block the 
5584,"delivery of the materials to the Corpmittee. The next day, the Court "
5585,"denied the petition, stating that the President, as the focus of the "
5586,grand jury report and the person who presumably would have the 
5587,"greatest interest in its disposition, interposed no objection to the "
5588,"District Court’s action. As a result, the report was delivered to the "
5589,"House Judiciary Committee on March 26. In addition, the President "
5590,delivered to the Committee the materials he had given to the Special 
5591,"Prosecutor. These included 12 recordings related to Watergate, "
5592,"seven related to ITT, dairy, and “Plumbers” matters, and numerous "
5593,documents relevant to these areas. 
5594,Cooperation With the House Judiciary Committee 
5595,"H. Res. 803, adopted x by the House of Representatives on February "
5596,"6 by a vote of 410 to 4, explicitly authorized the House Judiciary "
5597,Committee to investigate whether grounds existed for the impeach- 
5598,ment of Richard Nixon. The resolution also granted the Committee 
5599,the power of subpoena for its investigation. Preliminary discussions 
5600,on liaison between the staff of the House Judiciary Committee and 
5601,the Special Prosecutor’s office had been held more than two months 
5602,"earlier. In a meeting on November 20, 1973, between attorneys from "
5603,"the Special Prosecutor’s office and the Judiciary Committee, Deputy "
5604,Special Prosecutor Ruth had assured the Committee of WSPF’s 
5605,cooperation so long as such cooperation did not interfere with WSPF 
5606,investigations and trials and investigative sources were protected. 
5607,"Ruth’s pledge was subsequently honored by WSPF, despite a "
5608,"minor problem which arose in February 1974, when the Committee "
5609,"requested a detailed list of recordings, documents and other material "
5610,"the Special Prosecutor had received from the White House, plus a "
5611,list of the requests for evidence that had not been met. Special Prose- 
5612,cutor Jaworski’s original position was that Rule 6(e) of the Federal 
5613,"Rules of Criminal Procedure, which bars disclosure of matters occur- "
5614,"ring before a grand jury, prevented him from revealing this informa- "
5615,"tion. However, when St. Clair stated he had no objection, Jaworski "
5616,"supplied the Committee with the requested lists. On February 25, "
5617,after the Judiciary Committee received the list of materials obtained 
5618,"by the Special Prosecutor from the White House, Doar asked the "
5619,"White House to furnish the Committee with copies of certain materials, "
5620,including 19 tape recordings of Presidential conversations theretofore 
5621,"given to the Special Prosecutor, and all tape recordings, notes and "
5622,124
5623,other writings relating to 42 specifically identified Presidential 
5624,conversations which had not been supplied to the Special Prosecutor. 1 
5625,"As the Judiciary Committee’s inquiry progressed, its attorneys "
5626,recognized the need to gain access to materials under seal of the court 
5627,"in a number of “Watergate’ ’-related cases. In each instance, the "
5628,"Committee directed a formal motion to the court, with a request to "
5629,the Special Prosecutor to state his position. Responding to such an 
5630,"application in April by the Committee, 2 Jaworski stated that he had "
5631,no objection to having Committee staff review the material but was 
5632,"opposed to unsealing it. In one instance, Jaworski opposed access "
5633,to the record of the medical examination of ITT lobbyist Dita Beard 
5634,on the grounds that the results of the examination were not relevant 
5635,to the Committee’s inquiry and that disclosure would be unwarranted 
5636,intrusion on Beard’s rights. Jaworski also objected to access to grand 
5637,jury testimony submitted to Judge Gesell in the prosecution of former 
5638,"White House aide Dwight Chapin, due to the provisions of Rule "
5639,"6(e). In May, the Judiciary Committee again requested access to "
5640,"additional materials sealed by the court, 3 and again Jaworski was "
5641,asked to state his position. The Special Prosecutor replied that he 
5642,had no objection to the granting of the Committee’s access to these 
5643,"materials, since they did not appear likely to prejudice any individuals. "
5644,"In addition to sealed materials, the Judiciary Committee also re- "
5645,"quested copies of the grand jury testimony of Egil Krogh, David "
5646,"1 The 42 Presidential conversations were not provided, and on April 11, 1974, "
5647,the House Judiciary Committee issued the first of eight subpoenas directed to the 
5648,"President. In partial response to the subpoena, the President on April 30 supplied "
5649,"to the Committee, and released publicly, edited transcripts of 31 of the 42 sub- "
5650,"poenaed conversations, claiming that the other 11 conversations had either not "
5651,"been recorded or could not be located. On May 1, the Judiciary Committee "
5652,formally advised the President by letter that he had failed to comply with its 
5653,subpoena. The President’s failure to comply with this and other subpoenas 
5654,formed the basis for Article III of Impeachment later adopted by the House 
5655,Judiciary Committee. 
5656,2 The application sought material under seal in connection with the following 
5657,"matters: United States v. Chapin , Crim. No. 990-73; United States v. Krogh , Crim. "
5658,"No. 857-73; In Re Grand Jury Proceedings , Misc. 47-73; In Re Grand Jury Pro - "
5659,"ceedings , Misc. 108-73; United States v. Liddy, et at., Crim. No. 1827-72; Halperin "
5660,"v. Kissinger , et al ., Civil No. 1187-73; Ellsberg , et at. v. Mitchell , et al., Civil No. "
5661,"1879-72; Nader v. Internal Revenue Service , Civil No. 1851-72; Nader v. Butz , "
5662,"Civil No. 148-72; Common Cause v. Finance Committee to Re-Elect the President , "
5663,"et al.. Civil No, 1780-72. "
5664,"3 These were the May 13, 1974, transcript of in camera hearings on the Pres- "
5665,"ident’s motion to quash the April 18 subpoena issued in United States v. Mitchell , "
5666,"et al., the May 13, 1974, transcript of in camera hearings on the tape experts’ report "
5667,"and a pre-publication copy of the report. In addition, the Judiciary Committee "
5668,"requested permission to listen to the June 20, June 30 and September 15, 1972, "
5669,conversations to determine whether they were relevant to the Committee’s 
5670,inquiry. 
5671,125
5672,591-439 0 - 75 -9 
5673,Young and Henry Petersen in connection with the indictment re- 
5674,turned in the Fielding break-in case. This testimony was supplied to 
5675,the Committee by the court. 
5676,The Special Prosecutor’s office also supplied information directly 
5677,to the Committee throughout the impeachment inquiry. The basis 
5678,for WSPF’s action was set forth in a May 8 letter from Jaworski to 
5679,"Doar in which the Special Prosecutor stated his understanding that, "
5680,although WSPF was being asked to provide the information volun- 
5681,"tarily, the Committee was prepared to fulfill its responsibilities "
5682,"by issuing subpoenas. On the basis of this understanding, Jaworski "
5683,determined that his office would furnish such relevant information 
5684,"requested by the Committee as it possessed, within the bounds of "
5685,relevant laws and regulations. Jaworski also informed Doar that 
5686,WSPF staff attorneys would contact Committee staff attorneys to 
5687,coordinate the furnishing of requested information. 
5688,"On May 9, Ruth notified WSPF task force leaders of the pro- "
5689,cedures to be followed in providing information to the Committee: 
5690,there could be no disclosure of testimony presented before a grand 
5691,jury; no disclosure of information received from the White House 
5692,(Doar was arranging to receive from St. Clair what the White House 
5693,had supplied to the Special Prosecutor) ; documentary evidence would 
5694,be furnished only when the source of the information consented (the 
5695,same procedure used with the Senate Select Committee) ; only informa- 
5696,tion directly related to possible Presidential involvement would be 
5697,furnished ; confidentiality of witnesses would be preserved if necessary ; 
5698,and no notes of office interviews were to be supplied. Ruth further 
5699,directed that WSPF staff members recommend the names of witnesses 
5700,to be interviewed by the Committee and the topics to be covered in 
5701,such interviews. 
5702,"Pursuant to this arrangement, the Special Prosecutor’s office "
5703,provided the impeachment inquiry staff with numerous investigative 
5704,leads and with non-grand jury materials. Doar was permitted to exam- 
5705,"ine, in the Special Prosecutor’s office, a summary memorandum con- "
5706,"cerning “allegations involving the President.” In addition, the "
5707,Committee reviewed WSPF’s copies of White House transcripts of 
5708,"Nixon-Dean conversations between September 15, 1972, and April 16, "
5709,"1973, to determine if there were any discrepancies between them and "
5710,the transcripts published in the President’s submission to the Com- 
5711,mittee. The prosecutors also attempted to save the Committee’s 
5712,time by steering its investigation away from allegations that WSPF 
5713,had already determined to be frivolous or unfounded. 
5714,Since one of its areas of investigation was the relationship between 
5715,the White House and WSPF and the extent of White House coopera- 
5716,"tion with the Special Prosecutor, the Committee requested and re- "
5717,ceived from the Special Prosecutor’s office copies of correspondence 
5718,and memoranda relating to material sought from the White House 
5719,126
5720,by Special Prosecutors Cox and Jaworski. WSPF also supplied to the 
5721,Committee materials on Cox’s relations with the White House and 
5722,with Attorney General Richardson and on Jaworski’s relations with 
5723,the White House. 
5724,Cooperation between WSPF and the Committee was mutual. 
5725,The Special Prosecutor requested information from the Committee 
5726,to provide defendants with prior statements and testimony of Govern- 
5727,ment witnesses relating to their trial testimony as well as any material 
5728,in the Government’s possession favorable to the defendants. Although 
5729,WSPF contended that transmission of Congressional testimony to 
5730,"defendants was not required by law, the Office voluntarily provided "
5731,"such information, including Committee staff interviews of Egil Krogh "
5732,"for the Fielding break-in trial, staff interviews and statements of "
5733,"individuals connected with the Watergate cover-up trial, and staff "
5734,interviews and documents of individuals having knowledge of Presi- 
5735,dent Nixon’s tax returns and personal finances. 
5736,"As a result of the Committee’s investigation, on June 18 and 19, "
5737,"1974, Doar presented to the Committee a “Statement of Information” "
5738,containing evidence on the events that led to the appointment of 
5739,"Elliot Richardson as Attorney General, the creation of the Watergate "
5740,"Special Prosecution Force, the appointment of Archibald Cox, the "
5741,"authority and jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor’s office, the investi- "
5742,gations initiated by the Special Prosecutor and the response of Presi- 
5743,"dent Nixon to those investigations, the issuance of subpoenas to the "
5744,"President, the litigation arising out of his refusal to comply with "
5745,"those subpoenas, the firing of Cox, the appointment of Leon Jaworski, "
5746,"and the court hearings on the 18% minute erasure on the June 20, "
5747,"1972, tape. "
5748,"On July 29, by a vote of 28 to 10, the Committee adopted a second "
5749,Article of Impeachment against President Nixon. Article II charged 
5750,that the President had: 
5751,. . . repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitu- 
5752,"tional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper administra- "
5753,"tion of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening "
5754,the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the 
5755,purposes of these agencies. 
5756,"As an example of such conduct, the Committee stated: "
5757,"In disregard of the rule of law, he knowingly misused the "
5758,executive power by interfering with agencies of the executive 
5759,"branch, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the "
5760,Criminal Division and the Office of Watergate Special Prosecution 
5761,"Force, of the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence "
5762,"Agency, in violation of his duty to take care that the laws be "
5763,faithfully executed. 
5764,As supporting evidence for its conclusion that President Nixon 
5765,"had impeded the Special Prosecutor’s investigation, the Committee "
5766,127
5767,noted the White House delay in making information available to the 
5768,"Special Prosecutor and, in some cases, withholding documents, the "
5769,"concealment of the White House taping system, the firing of Cox, "
5770,and the refusal to cooperate with Jaworski. 
5771,The President's Resignation; Further Consideration Of Indictment 
5772,"On July 24, 1974, the Supreme Court announced its unanimous "
5773,decision in United States v. Nixon and ordered the President to turn 
5774,over additional tape recordings of Presidential conversations sub- 
5775,poenaed for use in the Watergate cover-up trial then scheduled to 
5776,begin in September. Among the subpoenaed conversations \vere those 
5777,"of June 23, 1972, between H. R. Haldeman and the President. On "
5778,"Monday, August 5, St. Clair and Alexander Haig, the President’s "
5779,"chief of staff, telephoned Jaworski to inform him that the June 23 "
5780,tape recording revealed the President’s early knowledge of the Water- 
5781,gate cover-up and a possible violation of law in his misuse of a Federal 
5782,"agency. On Thursda}"", August 8, Jaworski met with Haig, at the "
5783,latter’s request. Jaworski later told members of his staff that Haig 
5784,had called the meeting to inform him of the President’s decision to 
5785,"resign, but that during the meeting no promises or understandings of "
5786,any kind had been either requested or offered. In a statement issued 
5787,"immediately after the President’s resignation announcement, the "
5788,Special Prosecutor said : 
5789,There has been no agreement or understanding of any sort 
5790,between the President or his representatives and the Special 
5791,Prosecutor relating in any way to the President’s resignation. 
5792,The Special Prosecutor’s Office was not asked for any such 
5793,agreement or understanding and offered none. Although I was 
5794,"informed of the President’s decision this afternoon, my office did "
5795,not participate in any way in the President’s decision to resign. 
5796,"President Nixon’s resignation became effective at noon on Friday, "
5797,August 9. Shortly thereafter Jaworski was contacted by Herbert J. 
5798,"Miller, Jr., an attorney for the former President. During several "
5799,"meetings between Jaworski and Miller in August, Miller argued that "
5800,the former President should not be indicted because the massive 
5801,publicity resulting from both the impeachment proceedings and his 
5802,resignation would make it impossible to select an impartial jury. 
5803,"On September 4, Miller submitted to the Special Prosecutor an "
5804,extensive memorandum supporting this view. Research by the WSPF 
5805,"staff disputed Miller’s position, however, and Jaworski concluded that "
5806,any prosecution of the former President might require a nine-month 
5807,to one-year delay in bringing a case to trial in order to allow existing 
5808,and foreseeable pre-trial publicity to dissipate. 
5809,Another question raised in the wake of the resignation was whether 
5810,the former President should be included as a defendant in the Water- 
5811,128
5812,gate cover-up case. Jaworski invited members of WSPF’s legal staff 
5813,to submit their views on this question and other issues surrounding 
5814,"possible . criminal action against the former President, and many did. "
5815,Since it was evident to the Special Prosecutor and to staff members 
5816,that inclusion of the former President would entail considerable if 
5817,"not indefinite delay of the trial, which was then scheduled to begin "
5818,"on October 1, Jaworski decided against such inclusion. He also decided "
5819,to defer any criminal action against the former President until the 
5820,"cover-up jury was sequestered, to eliminate the possibility that the "
5821,jurors might be subjected to additional pre-trial publicity. 
5822,The Pardon 
5823,"On August 28, President Ford held a nationally televised press "
5824,"conference, his first since taking office. During that press conference, "
5825,the President answered several questions regarding a possible pardon 
5826,for his predecessor : 
5827,"Q : Mr. President, aside from the Special Prosecutor’s role, do "
5828,you agree with the Bar Association that the laws apply equally 
5829,"to all men, or do you agree with Governor Rockefeller that former "
5830,"President Nixon should have immunity from prosecution, and "
5831,"specifically, would you use your pardon authority, if necessary? "
5832,"A: Well, let me say at the outset that I made a statement in "
5833,"this room in the few months [sic] after the swearing-in, and on "
5834,that occasion I said the following: That I had hoped that our 
5835,"former President, who brought peace to millions, would find it for "
5836,himself. 
5837,"# Now, the expression made by Governor Rockefeller, I think, "
5838,coincides with the general view and the point of view of the 
5839,"American people. I subscribe to that point of view, but let me "
5840,add in the last ten days or two weeks I have asked for prayers 
5841,for guidance on this very important point. 
5842,"In this situation, I am the final authority. There have been no "
5843,"charges made, there has been no action by the courts, there has "
5844,"been no action by any jury, and until any legal process has been "
5845,"undertaken, I think it is unwise and untimely for me to make any "
5846,commitment. 
5847,****** * 
5848,"Q: May I just follow up on Helen’s question: You are saying, "
5849,"sir, that the option of a pardon for former President Nixon is "
5850,"still an option that you will consider, depending on what the courts "
5851,will do. 
5852,"A: Of course, I make the final decision. Until it gets to me, "
5853,I make no commitment one way or the other. But I do have the 
5854,right as President of the United States to make that decision. 
5855,Q: And you are not ruling it out? 
5856,A : I am not ruling it out. It is an option and a proper option 
5857,for any President. 
5858,Q: Do you feel the Special Prosecutor can in good conscience 
5859,pursue cases against former top Nixon aides as long as there is 
5860,129
5861,the possibility that the former President may not also be pursued 
5862,in the courts? 
5863,"A: I think the Special Prosecutor, Mr. Jaworski, has an obli- "
5864,gation to take whatever action he sees fit in conformity with his 
5865,"oath of office, and that should include any and all individuals. "
5866,* * * * * * * 
5867,"Q: Mr. President, you have emphasized here your option of "
5868,granting a pardon to the former President. 
5869,A: I intend to. 
5870,"Q : You intend to have that option. If an indictment is brought, "
5871,would you grant a pardon before any trial took place? 
5872,"A : I said at the outset that until the matter reaches me, I am "
5873,not going to make any comment during the process of whatever 
5874,charges are made. 
5875,Jaworski had made it plain to staff members that he would not 
5876,seek the former President’s indictment if President Ford intended 
5877,"to pardon him. Accordingly, he met with Philip W. Buchen, President "
5878,"Ford’s counsel, on September 4. Jaworski reported later to staff "
5879,members that during this meeting he had advised Buchen that the 
5880,President’s statements at the press conference had put the Special 
5881,Prosecutor in a “peculiar position” since the President’s comments 
5882,suggested that any action taken by WSPF against former President 
5883,Nixon might prove to be futile. Jaworski also reported that he had 
5884,"made no recommendation to Buchen concerning a possible pardon, "
5885,since he considered the issue to be wholly the President’s prerogative 
5886,and felt that it would be inappropriate for him to make an unsolicited 
5887,recommendation. At Buchen’s request as to the probable length of time 
5888,"between an indictment and a trial, Jaworski delivered to him a letter "
5889,expressing the following view on trial delay : 
5890,The factual situation regarding a trial of Richard M. Nixon 
5891,"within constitutional bounds, is unprecedented. It is especially "
5892,unique in view of the recent House Judiciary Committee inquiry 
5893,"on impeachment, resulting in a unanimous adverse finding to "
5894,Richard M. Nixon on the Article involving obstruction of justice. 
5895,The massive publicity given the hearings and the findings that 
5896,"ensued, the reversal of judgment of a number of the members of "
5897,the Republican Party following release of the June 23 tape re- 
5898,"cording, and their statements carried nationwide, and finally, "
5899,"the resignation of Richard M. Nixon, require a delay, before "
5900,"selection of a jury is begun, of a period from nine months to a "
5901,"year, and perhaps even longer. This judgment is predicated on a "
5902,review of the decisions of United States Courts involving prejudicial 
5903,pre-trial publicity. The Government’s decision to pursue im- 
5904,"peachment proceedings and the tremendous volume of television, "
5905,"radio and newspaper coverage given thereto, are factors em- "
5906,phasized by the Courts in weighing the time a trial can be had. 
5907,The complexities involved in the process of selecting a jury and 
5908,"the time it will take to complete the process, I find difficult to "
5909,estimate at this time. 
5910,The situation involving Richard M. Nixon is readily dis- 
5911,tinguishable from the facts involved in the case of United States v. 
5912,130
5913,"Mitchell , a/., [the Watergate cover-up case] set for trial on "
5914,September 30th. The defendants in the Mitchell case were in- 
5915,dicted by a grand jury operating in secret session. They will be 
5916,"called to trial, unlike Richard M. Nixon, if indicted, without "
5917,any previous adverse finding by an investigatory body holding 
5918,public hearings on its conclusions. It is precisely the condemnation 
5919,"of Richard M. Nixon already made in the impeachment process, "
5920,that would make it unfair to the defendants in the case of United 
5921,"States v. Mitchell , et al ., for Richard M. Nixon now to be joined "
5922,"as a co-conspirator, should it be concluded that an indictment "
5923,of him was proper. 
5924,"The United States v. Mitchell , et al., trial will within itself "
5925,"generate new publicity, some undoubtedly prejudicial to Rich- "
5926,ard M. Nixon. I bear this in mind when I estimate the earliest 
5927,time of trial of Richard M. Nixon under his constitutional guar- 
5928,"antees, in the event of indictment, to be as indicated above. "
5929,"During their meeting, Jaworski also submitted to Buchen a memo- "
5930,"randum prepared by Deputy Special Prosecutor Ruth, listing ten "
5931,matters under investigation which “may^ prove to have some direct 
5932,connection to activities in which Mr. Nixon is personally involved.” 
5933,The memorandum cautioned that “none of these matters at the 
5934,moment rises to the level of our ability to prove even a probable 
5935,"criminal violation by Mr. Nixon.” The memorandum explicitly stated, "
5936,"however, that it was not intended to deal with the former President's "
5937,possible liability in connection with the Watergate cover-up. 
5938,"On September 8 President Ford granted a “full, free and absolute” "
5939,pardon to former President Nixon for all offenses committed during 
5940,"Mr. Nixon's tenure as President (January 20, 1969, through August 9, "
5941,1974). President Ford's action generated extensive discussion and legal 
5942,research by WSPF. 
5943,This focused upon two possible theories to challenge the pardon. 
5944,"First, was it invalid because it preceded any indictment or conviction? "
5945,"And second, despite the President's inherent constitutional powers to "
5946,"control all law enforcement decisions, whether by directing that an "
5947,"investigation not proceed, ordering an indictment dismissed, or grant- "
5948,"ing a pardon, had the President voluntarily bound himself through the "
5949,Special Prosecutor's charter not to exercise his constitutional pardon 
5950,powers when the exercise of that power would interfere with the inde- 
5951,pendent judgment of the Special Prosecutor to decide whom to 
5952,prosecute? 
5953,The Special Prosecutor initially declined to make public any of his 
5954,views concerning the pardon in view of the approaching Watergate 
5955,"trial and the order of the court regarding pre-trial publicity. Later, "
5956,"after the Watergate trial jury had been sequestered, he stated the "
5957,basis of his decision not to challenge the validity of the pardon in a 
5958,131
5959,"letter to Attorney General William Saxbe, dated October 12, which "
5960,accompanied his letter of resignation as Special Prosecutor: 
5961,Although not appropriate for comment until after the sequester- 
5962,"ing of the jury in United States v. Mitchell , et al ., in view of sugges- "
5963,tions that an indictment be returned against former President 
5964,Richard M. Nixon questioning the validity of the pardon granted 
5965,"him, I think it proper that I express to you my views on this subject "
5966,to dispel any thought that there may be some relation between my 
5967,resignation and that issue. 
5968,"As you realize, one of my responsibilities, not only as an "
5969,"officer of the court, but as a prosecutor, as well, is not to take a "
5970,position in which I lack faith or which my judgment dictates 
5971,is not supported by probable cause. The provision in the Constitu- 
5972,"tion investing the President with the right to grant pardons, "
5973,and the recognition by the United States Supreme Court that 
5974,"a, pardon may be granted prior to the filing of charges are so clear, "
5975,"in my opinion, as not to admit of doubt. Philip Lacovara, then "
5976,"Counsel to the Special Prosecutor, by written memorandum on "
5977,"file in this office, came to the same conclusion, pointing out that : "
5978,. . the pardon power can be exercised at any time after 
5979,a federal crime has been committed and it is not necessary that 
5980,"there be any criminal proceedings pending. In fact, the pardon "
5981,power has been used frequently to relieve federal offenders of 
5982,criminal liability and other penalties and disabilities attaching 
5983,to their offenses even where no criminal proceedings against the 
5984,individual are contemplated.” 
5985,"I have also concluded, after thorough study that there is "
5986,nothing in the charter and guidelines appertaining to the office 
5987,of the Special Prosecutor that impairs or curtails the President's 
5988,free exercise of the constitutional right of pardon. 
5989,I was co-architect along with Acting Attorney General Robert 
5990,"Bork, of the provisions some theorists now point to as inhibiting "
5991,the constitutional pardoning power of the President. The additional 
5992,safeguards of independence on which I insisted and which 
5993,"Mr. Bork, on former President Nixon's authority, was willing to "
5994,grant were solely for purposes of limiting the grounds on which 
5995,my discharge could be based and not for the purpose of enlarging 
5996,on the jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor. 
5997,Hearings held by the Senate Judiciary Committee subsequent 
5998,to my appointment make it clear that my jurisdiction as Special 
5999,Prosecutor was to be no different from that possessed by my 
6000,predecessor. 
6001,There was considerable concern expressed by some Senators 
6002,"that Acting Attorney General Bork, by supplemental order, in- "
6003,advertently had limited the jurisdiction that previously existed. 
6004,The hearings fully developed the concept that the thrust of the 
6005,new provisions giving me the aid of the Congressional “consensus” 
6006,committee were to insulate me from groundless efforts to terminate 
6007,my employment or to limit the jurisdiction that existed. It was 
6008,"made clear, however, that there was no “redefining” of the juris- "
6009,diction of the Special Prosecutor as it existed from the beginning. 
6010,There emerged from these hearings the definite understanding that 
6011,in no sense were the additional provisions inserted in the Special 
6012,Prosecutor's Charter for the purpose of either enlarging or diminish- 
6013,132
6014,"ing his jurisdiction. I did stress, as I argued in the Supreme Court "
6015,"in U.S . v. Nixon , that I was given the verbal assurance that I "
6016,"could bring suit against the President to enforce subpoena rights, "
6017,"a point upheld by the Court. This, of course, has no bearing on the "
6018,pardoning power. 
6019,"I cannot escape the conclusion, therefore, that additional "
6020,provisions to the Charter do not subordinate the constitutional 
6021,pardoning power to the Special Prosecutor's jurisdictional rights. 
6022,For me now to contend otherwise would not only be contrary to 
6023,the interpretation agreed upon in Congressional hearings — it also 
6024,"would be, on my part, intellectually dishonest. "
6025,"Thus, in light of these conclusions, for me to procure an indict- "
6026,ment of Richard M. Nixon for the sole purpose of generating a 
6027,"purported court test on the legality of the pardon, would consti- "
6028,"tute a spurious proceeding in which I had no faith; in fact, it "
6029,would be tantamount to unprofessional conduct and violative of 
6030,my responsibility as prosecutor and officer of the court. 
6031,133
6032,Concluding Observations 
6033,and Recommendations 
6034,"Normally when prosecutors are asked to recommend reforms, the "
6035,questions are limited to the criminal justice system. But most of what 
6036,WSPF personnel experienced in criminal justice was dramatically 
6037,atypical of criminal justice generally. The prosecutors had adequate 
6038,resources; defendants were not jailed for long periods of time prior to 
6039,trial; the courts had time and resources to meet all the demands of 
6040,"Watergate litigation in a detached, unhurried atmosphere; private "
6041,defense counsel brought all their skills to thorough pretrial investiga- 
6042,"tion, legal attack, trial strategy and fully-briefed appeals; the sections "
6043,of Federal prisons in which convicted Watergate defendants served 
6044,"their terms all lacked the small, inhuman spaces in which most Ameri- "
6045,"can criminals reside, locked into their idleness for 17 hours each day; "
6046,and constant press and public scrutiny provided a careful watchdog to 
6047,make sure that Government investigations proceeded without abuse 
6048,of power or undue leniency. Watergate did not educate American 
6049,"citizens about the normal, day-to-day criminal justice process. "
6050,"In considering what recommendations to include in this report, "
6051,WSPF concentrated on what it did observe: criminal abuse of power 
6052,by Government officials in high places ; historical growth of secrecy in 
6053,the Federal executive branch unchecked by Americans and their 
6054,"elected Congress; unchallenged, subjective judgments by the executive "
6055,branch in identifying persons and organizations that constitute an 
6056,impermissible threat to the national interest and to executive policy; 
6057,"an undemocratic condition wherein money is power, and skillful, "
6058,"cynical public relations cements that power; and finally, a silent, "
6059,"sometimes grudging, sometimes willful conclusion by some Govern- "
6060,ment representatives that ethical standards are irrelevant because 
6061,"quick implementation of policy goals is mandatory, but achievable "
6062,only by social and personal injustices to others. 
6063,These conclusions all arose from observing how Government 
6064,officials and agencies actually grapple with the legitimate demands 
6065,upon them. The demands of national security require extraordinary 
6066,judgment. The separation of powers concept requires judicious use of 
6067,the privilege doctrine. Politicians cannot be elected without extensive 
6068,campaign funds and loyal friends who want rewards. Individual 
6069,m 
6070,requirements for personal success seem always to demand that one 
6071,must “ride with the system.” And a leader hoping to implement his 
6072,policies is loathe to choose anyone whose independence or unpredict- 
6073,able mind may eventually undermine or delay those goals. 
6074,"These demands have always had, and will continue to have, in- "
6075,herent potential for abuse of power. National security can easily be 
6076,"used to justify unconstitutional actions, and executive privilege can "
6077,then be invoked to justify the failure to disclose these actions. Sub- 
6078,jective distrust can be identified mistakenly with a national need 
6079,that justifies massive intelligence systems with permanent storage 
6080,"and illicit use of personal information. Political survival, rationalized "
6081,"by one’s perceived ability to accomplish the national will, can too "
6082,easily justify the acceptance of “big money” and the granting of 
6083,instant access to any friend of one’s cause or one’s administration. The 
6084,leader who sets out to accomplish his goals may appoint as executives 
6085,only those who helped him along the political path and who will 
6086,give him support that disregards independent analysis or the demands 
6087,of personal will and courage. 
6088,"This brief and, by no means, original or exclusive catalog should "
6089,sound familiar to all readers of this report. Many of the Watergate 
6090,phenomena had their historical precedents. Many had grown with no 
6091,deterrence from other branches of Government. Others had grown 
6092,without questions from the people and from the press. Watergate 
6093,should not be analyzed merely in the context of each individual 
6094,abuse of power that prosecutors were told to investigate. As with 
6095,"any coalescing of activities that lead to a national crisis, so too did "
6096,Watergate grow from historical roots that presaged abuses of institu- 
6097,tional power. 
6098,If Watergate was an insidious climax to recent and hitherto subtle 
6099,"historical trends, the formulation of recommendations must begin with "
6100,"the simple, but basic, observation that democracies do not survive "
6101,unless elected officials do what they are supposed to do and citizens 
6102,maintain vigilance to see that they do. The public unfolding of Water- 
6103,"gate abuses resulted from citizen, press and official actions. Nothing "
6104,can replace that kind of vigilance; and recommendations for new laws 
6105,"or new institutions are insignificant when compared to the stubborn, "
6106,"plodding, daily work of Americans and their elected representatives "
6107,in watching over and channeling the power of their national Govern- 
6108,"ment, the power of concentrated wealth, the power of officially spoken "
6109,"and written words, and the power of secret bureaucracies. "
6110,As prosecutors searching only for facts that disclose or disclaim 
6111,"criminal activity, WSPF lacks the expertise to propose a broad base "
6112,of political and social change. The recommendations that follow are 
6113,not so intended. The proposals are modest but their implementa- 
6114,tion would probably help. Most appear easy and obvious. But that is 
6115,a good way to start testing a Nation’s willingness to learn from its past. 
6116,135
6117,RECOMMENDATIONS 
6118,Protecting the Integrity and Effectiveness of the Prosecution Function 
6119,"The integrity of Government officials, from the President down, "
6120,depends in part on the credibility of criminal statutes as a deterrent 
6121,to misconduct. This credibility in turn depends on the capacity of 
6122,the system of justice to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing wherever 
6123,"it occurs. At a minimum, this means that the Department of Justice "
6124,must be capable of exercising it prosecution functions free of undue 
6125,"influence or conflicts of interest. At the same time, many of the "
6126,functions of the Department are legitimate subjects of Presidential 
6127,"concern on a policy level, and the President needs as Attorney General "
6128,a legal adviser in whom he has full confidence. Tf the Department is 
6129,properly insulated from partisan politics and from service to an 
6130,"Administration's purely political interests, it would not seem neces- "
6131,sary to take the major institutional steps of making the Attorney 
6132,General's office elective or creating a permanent special prosecutor's 
6133,office. 
6134,Independence oj Department of Justice Officials. The President 
6135,should not nominate and the Senate should not confirm as Attorney 
6136,"General, or as any other appointee in high Department of Justice "
6137,"posts, a person who has served as the President's campaign manager "
6138,or in a similar high-level campaign role. A campaign manager seeks 
6139,support for his candidate and necessarily incurs obligations to political 
6140,leaders and other individuals throughout wide geographical areas. If 
6141,"he then takes a high position in the Justice Department, he may take — "
6142,or appear to take — official actions on the basis of those commitments 
6143,rather than on appropriate legal and policy grounds. The Attorney 
6144,General and other Justice Department appointees should be lawyers 
6145,"with their own reputations in the legal profession, with capacity and "
6146,"willingness to make independent judgments, and with the authority "
6147,to choose similarly qualified persons for subordinate positions. In 
6148,"advising and consenting on Presidential nominees, Senators should "
6149,apply to Justice Department appointees standards of character and 
6150,independence similar to those they apply to nominees for the Supreme 
6151,Court. Similar standards should attach to the appointment and 
6152,confirmation of United States Attorneys. 
6153,"The Hatch Act, which prohibits most Federal employees from "
6154,"taking an active part in political management or campaigns, should "
6155,"be amended to apply to all employees of the Department of Justice, "
6156,"including the Attorney General . 1 However, the amendment should "
6157,make clear that high Department officials are not violating the 
6158,1 Current penalty provisions may not be suited to such a revision. If an 
6159,"amendment is contemplated, thought must be given to appropriate sanctions for "
6160,violations. 
6161,136
6162,prohibition of political activity when they discuss and defend De- 
6163,partment policies and actions on their merits in public forums. 
6164,"Contacts About Pending Cases. In August 1973, Attorney General "
6165,"Richardson issued Order No. 532-73, requiring all Justice Department "
6166,employees to record in memorandum form each oral communication 
6167,“concerning a case or other matter pending before the Department 
6168,with a non-involved party indicating an interest in the case or matter.” 
6169,This order was meant to deter improper contacts by creating a written 
6170,record of any attempt to influence Department handling of cases. 
6171,Subsequent debate within the Department of Justice has questioned 
6172,the breadth of the order and the lack of an enforcement mechanism. 
6173,"For example, the memorandum as now written could include casual "
6174,social contacts in which a total stranger voices a citizen view about 
6175,a pending Department matter. 
6176,The Attorney General should resolve these problems of coverage 
6177,and reissue the Order. Attempted political persuasion and other 
6178,"efforts by non-involved parties to secure direct, out-of-channel access "
6179,to Department personnel should all be part of official records. 
6180,Increased Federal Efforts Against Corruption Without Creation of a 
6181,Permanent Special Prosecutor . The Senate Select Committee reacted 
6182,to their Watergate hearings by recommending the creation of a 
6183,permanent special prosecutor’s office. The proposed new officer would 
6184,be appointed by the judiciary and confirmed by the Senate. He would 
6185,be independent of the Attorney General in making all his decisions 
6186,and have jurisdiction over most corrupt acts committed b}^ Federal 
6187,employees and also over political campaign crimes. 
6188,The principal reason cited for such an institution is the perceived 
6189,incapacity of the Justice Department to investigate fully allegations 
6190,of criminal conduct by high officials. Since the Attorney General is 
6191,"a Presidential appointee, it is argued, his subordinates cannot be "
6192,expected to seek or uncover misconduct by high officials whose prose- 
6193,"cution might embarrass the President. The problem is most acute, of "
6194,"course, when the alleged wrongdoer is the President himself ; but it is "
6195,substantial when the subject of investigation is a Presidential appointee 
6196,at any level. Justice Department investigators may be equally 
6197,frustrated in efforts to prosecute the President’s judicial appointees or 
6198,political allies in Congress; even members of Congress who belong to 
6199,the opposing party may be immune from prosecution because of a 
6200,“live and let live” political tradition that survives changes of Adminis- 
6201,tration and protects politicians even after they leave office. An 
6202,"independent special prosecutor, not subject to such considerations, "
6203,would pursue wrongdoing in Government solely on an objective 
6204,basis. 
6205,No one who has watched “Watergate” unfold can doubt that the 
6206,Justice Department has difficulty investigating and prosecuting high 
6207,"officials, or that an independent prosecutor is freer to act according "
6208,137
6209,to politically neutral principles of fairness and justice. But the question 
6210,is whether such independence should be institutionalized on a perma- 
6211,nent basis. Do the advantages of such a step outweigh its disadvan- 
6212,tages? 
6213,WSPF is opposed to the idea of extending the special prosecutor 
6214,concept on a permanent basis. Central to the question is the fact that 
6215,such a public officer would be largely immune from the accountabilit}^ 
6216,that prosecutors and other public officials constantly face. Lack of 
6217,accountability of an official on a permanent basis carries a potential 
6218,for abuse of power that far exceeds any enforcement gains that might 
6219,ensue. An independent prosecutor reports directly on ongoing investi- 
6220,"gations to no one, takes directions from no one and could easily abuse "
6221,his power with little chance of detection. Although matters that reach 
6222,court obviously invoke court control over a prosecutor’s public con- 
6223,"duct, the discretionary process of initiating and conducting investi- "
6224,"gations bears great potential for hidden actions that are unfair, "
6225,"arbitrary, dishonest, or subjectively biased. "
6226,"Ordinarily, prosecutors are accountable either directly to the "
6227,electorate or indirectly through the elected officials who appoint 
6228,"them. Under proposed legislation, a permanent special prosecutor "
6229,would not be subject to such accountability. In extraordinary situa- 
6230,"tions such as “Watergate,” an independent prosecutor can be held "
6231,accountable directly to the public because his actions are subject to 
6232,intense and continuous press scrutiny. But such high visibility cannot 
6233,be expected for a permanent office dealing day to day with less explo- 
6234,sive matters. 
6235,Much of the Watergate and preceding abuses resulted from the 
6236,public’s delegation of public responsibilities to powerful men whose 
6237,judgments were trusted and whose claimed need for secrecy was 
6238,always accepted. Men with unchecked power and unchallenged trust 
6239,too often come to believe that their own perceptions of priorities and 
6240,the common good coincide with the national will. There is no reason 
6241,"to believe that, in the long run, an independent special prosecutor’s "
6242,office would avoid this status. 
6243,Other problems exist. Anyone who has observed bureaucracies 
6244,realizes that a “special” organization rarely retains its “special” 
6245,"qualities beyond a 3-year period. New organizations, large or small, "
6246,"start with a burst of speed, energy, imagination, enthusiasm, flexibility, "
6247,"long daily hours, and almost uniform high quality of personnel. That "
6248,level is hardly ever maintained over a long period by a permanent 
6249,organization in either the public or private sector. This is a problem 
6250,"for Government generally and should be addressed as such, not just "
6251,as to law enforcement. But there is no reason to believe that a per- 
6252,manent special prosecutor’s office would be immune from the rigidity 
6253,"that comes over most organizations after the initial period. Indeed, "
6254,this would probably happen to the Watergate Special Prosecution 
6255,138
6256,Force if it were to continue beyond the period in which it has been 
6257,"needed. Such rigidity is especially likely, and especially harmful, in "
6258,an agency that is as upaccountable as a permanent special prosecutor 
6259,would be. 
6260,A third reason for opposing the proposed new office relates to 
6261,problems with which WSPF constantly wrestled. Should our inter- 
6262,"pretation of the campaign laws, the coverage of statutes of limitation, "
6263,"and the perjury, false statement, and obstruction statutes coincide "
6264,with those of the Justice Department? Should our policies regarding 
6265,the use of various intrusive investigative techniques coincide with 
6266,"the Attorney General's? One is moved to answer in the affirmative, "
6267,since those policies are promulgated under normal democratic condi- 
6268,tions of accountability and since different policies easily lead to 
6269,unequal justice. These policy determinations provide great potential 
6270,for a special prosecutor's abuse of power. He can easily stretch from 
6271,proper investigative techniques or attempt unfairly to widen the 
6272,"conduct or the persons included within a criminal sanction. Thus, that "
6273,relatively small group of persons falling within a permanent special 
6274,prosecutor's jurisdiction could be subject to a much heavier hammer of 
6275,Federal criminal law than the rest of the Nation which is subject to 
6276,Department of Justice standards. 
6277,"In looking for alternatives to a permanent, independent prose- "
6278,"cutor, one must first turn to the problem of resource allocation. When "
6279,"the Department of Justice commenced a specialized, intensive effort "
6280,against organized crime in 1958 — with a dramatic expansion in 
6281,1961 — prosecutors found a nationwide string of racketeering enter- 
6282,prises that only a few enforcement personnel had thought existed. 
6283,"So too, in recent years, with adequate resources and personnel the "
6284,"United States Attorneys for the Southern District of New York, the "
6285,"’Northern District of Illinois, Maryland, Florida, New Jersey and "
6286,"elsewhere were able to uncover extensive Federal corruption. Thus, "
6287,these Justice Department representatives have prosecuted Federal 
6288,"executives, members of Congress and a Vice President. "
6289,"This visible, concentrated effort should be institutionalized within "
6290,the Department of Justice. An effort similar to that devoted to 
6291,organized crime should be placed in an expanded section within the 
6292,"Criminal Division or, similar to the proposal of Senators Baker and "
6293,"Percy, in. a new Division of Government Crimes with an Assistant "
6294,Attorney General appointed by the President. This new office should 
6295,also have constant coordination and monitoring responsibilities with 
6296,the various Inspectors General who now inquire into possible corrup- 
6297,tion in the Federal executive departments. 
6298,"In addition, the Attorney General should freely exercise his "
6299,"existing power to appoint special assistants as prosecutors, with "
6300,"independence for particular investigations and cases, whenever a "
6301,real or apparent conflict of interest threatens public confidence in 
6302,139
6303,"the enforcement system. On several occasions, WSPF borrowed "
6304,lawyers from the Department and special assistants can be afforded 
6305,the same advantage for their staffs. 
6306,"Finally, the absence of a permanent, independent prosecutor "
6307,need not dispel the idea that an independent prosecution office can 
6308,"be appointed in the future when activities by the executive, legislative "
6309,or judicial branches of Government show the necessity of a temporary 
6310,office similar to WSPF. 
6311,Congress has the power to enact a statute requiring the President 
6312,"or Attorney General to appoint such a prosecutor, with appropriate "
6313,"safeguards of his jurisdiction and independence, and two-thirds "
6314,majorities of both Houses have the power to override a Presidential 
6315,"veto of such legislation if necessary. In addition, the nature of the "
6316,relationship between Congress and the executive branch provides 
6317,other means of compelling such an appointment. WSPF was created 
6318,because the Senate insisted on such action as a condition of confirming 
6319,the nomination of an Attorney General. Congress can similarly use 
6320,its power to appropriate funds and the Senate can use its confirmation 
6321,power to force such action if necessary. The remedy of impeachment 
6322,remains available as a last resort. 
6323,Attorney Representation of Multiple Interests in Grand Jury Pro- 
6324,ceedings . In almost every investigation which centers on the criminal 
6325,activity of one or more members of a hierarchical structure — whether 
6326,"a corporation, labor union, a Government agency, or a less formally "
6327,organized group — the prosecutor is confronted with a witness who 
6328,"has been called to testify about his employers. Many times, the wit- "
6329,ness is represented by an attorney who also represents the employer 
6330,and perhaps is compensated by him. Although the legal profession’s 
6331,Code of Professional Responsibility forbids a lawyer from representing 
6332,"conflicting or even potentially conflicting interests, lawyers and "
6333,judges historically have been reluctant to enforce the Code’s mandate 
6334,"strictly. They have taken the position that, so long as the witness "
6335,understands that his attorney also represents the person or entity 
6336,about which he will be asked to testify and that he has the right to a 
6337,"lawyer of his own choosing, he cannot be forced to retain new counsel. "
6338,"No lay witness, however, can realistically be expected to appreciate "
6339,"all the legal and practical ramifications of his attorney’s dual loyalties, "
6340,and in many cases he will be precluded from giving adequate consid- 
6341,eration to the possibility of cooperating with the Government by the 
6342,fear that the fact of his cooperation will be revealed to his employer. 
6343,A mere inquiry by the judge in open court concerning the witness’ 
6344,"preference is not likely to elicit a truthful response. It is necessary, "
6345,"therefore, for the court to intervene more directly by making a factual "
6346,determination as to the existence of the conflict of interest and then 
6347,"requiring the witness to retain, or appointing for him, counsel who has "
6348,no such conflict. Although there will obviously be great reluctance to 
6349,140
6350,"interfere with the individual's freedom to select his own attorney, the "
6351,suggested course is the only one that can preserve the equally valid 
6352,right of the Government to his full and truthful testimony. 
6353,Both the courts and the various bar groups should be alerted to 
6354,the serious issues of professional responsibility arising out of the re- 
6355,"presentation of multiple interests during grand jury investigations, 2 "
6356,and Government counsel should press on every justifiable occasion for 
6357,"a judicial ruling on the question of conflict of interest and, where a "
6358,"conflict is found, for the replacement of the attorney involved. "
6359,Clarification of the Status under the Freedom of Information Act of 
6360,Information Obtained in Confidence by Criminal Investigators . Under 
6361,"the Freedom of Information Act as amended in 1974, a prosecutor’s "
6362,"investigative files are exempt from disclosure, but only to the extent "
6363,that production would : 
6364,"(A) interfere with enforcement proceedings, . "
6365,(B) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
6366,"adjudication, "
6367,"(C) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, "
6368,"(D) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the "
6369,case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority 
6370,"in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conduct- "
6371,"ing a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confiden- "
6372,"tial information furnished only by the confidential source, "
6373,"(E) disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or "
6374,(F) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement 
6375,personnel. 
6376,Much of the information received by WSPF was received either 
6377,upon an express assurance of confidentiality or upon a reasonable 
6378,understanding that the information would not be disclosed except as 
6379,"necessary in court proceedings. In some cases, disclosure of such infor- "
6380,mation would not interfere with ongoing investigations or prosecu- 
6381,"tions, or constitute an unwarranted invasion of anyone’s privacy. "
6382,"The question then arises whether the disclosures of such information, "
6383,"even if the source has been identified publicly, would “interfere with "
6384,enforcement proceedings” and hence be protected from disclosure. 
6385,The statute can and should be interpreted to protect the con- 
6386,fidentiality of such information. Successful investigation and prosecu- 
6387,"tion, particularly in the areas of official corruption and “white-collar” "
6388,"crime, often depend heavily on the voluntary cooperation of the "
6389,subjects of the investigation or their close associates. This cooperation 
6390,would diminish substantially if information from such sources was 
6391,subject to ready disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act 
6392,after the inquiry was closed. 
6393,2 A committee of the American Bar Association is studying the general ques- 
6394,tion of multiple representation in criminal proceedings and should extend its 
6395,inquiry to cover the grand jury stage as well. 
6396,141
6397,"In this sense, public disclosure would interfere with law enforce- "
6398,ment proceedings and the information would be protected under the 
6399,"current language of the statute. However, the language is sufficiently "
6400,ambiguous that its interpretation could involve litigation that would 
6401,"extend for several years. The very existence of such litigation, putting "
6402,in doubt the validity of prosecutors’ assurances to sources of informa- 
6403,"tion, might deter many persons from cooperating with Federal law "
6404,enforcement authorities. The statute’s language suggests that Con- 
6405,gress weighed the value of such cooperation against the value of dis- 
6406,closure and concluded that the former should receive greater weight. 
6407,The statute should be amended to make clear that information 
6408,furnished on a confidential basis to a Federal law enforcement agency 
6409,is protected from disclosure. 
6410,Protecting the Integrity of 
6411,Executive Branch Functions in Law Enforcement 
6412,"Some of the actual abuses of “Watergate”, and many attempted "
6413,"abuses, can be traced to pressures upon agencies with law-enforcement "
6414,functions by requests or directives from White House staff members 
6415,whose purpose was to serve the President’s political interest. Execu- 
6416,"tive branch agencies with these kinds of responsibilities, such as the "
6417,"Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal "
6418,"Revenue Service, should respond to Presidential direction in broad "
6419,policy areas and should be generally accountable to the President for 
6420,the performance of their functions. But their responsiveness should 
6421,"not be such as to make them part of the President’s political apparatus, "
6422,particularly since their powers and duties involve basic rights of 
6423,citizens. 
6424,Independence of Agency Heads and Staff. The persons appointed 
6425,by the President and confirmed by the Senate to head such agencies as 
6426,"the FBI, IRS and the Secret Service should, like the Attorney General, "
6427,"be highly qualified individuals, with independent reputations, who "
6428,had not taken leading roles in the President’s political campaigns. 
6429,They should be capable of making independent judgments and 
6430,authorized to appoint similarly qualified subordinates. In exercising 
6431,their power to advise and consent to Presidential nominations of such 
6432,"officials, Senators should stress the sensitivity of the respective "
6433,agencies’ functions and the danger of their over-responsiveness to 
6434,political concerns. 
6435,Congressional Oversight. The oversight powers and responsibilities 
6436,of Congress can provide an effective restraint on possible misuse of 
6437,such sensitive agencies. Congress should exercise effective policy 
6438,"oversight in areas subject to abuse, such as law enforcement and in- "
6439,telligence functions. Recent disclosures about some of the activities 
6440,"of the CIA, FBI, and IRS suggest that such oversight has been seri- "
6441,*42 
6442,ously deficient in the past. Oversight should include regular review of 
6443,"agency policies, the nature of priority programs, allocations of re- "
6444,"sources, intelligence programs, internal inspection procedures, com- "
6445,"pliance with audit requirements, and similar indications of the manner "
6446,in which such agencies are performing their sensitive functions. The 
6447,"oversight function can and should include, without the need for new "
6448,"laws, a regular monitoring of the nature and frequency of White "
6449,House action directives about individuals subject to possible scrutiny 
6450,"by the enforcement agencies. Policy oversight, however, should not "
6451,"be allowed to become Congressional intervention in particular matters, "
6452,"such as criminal and tax investigations, in which the agencies are "
6453,engaged; over-responsiveness to the personal or political interests of 
6454,Members of Congress is no less evil than over-responsiveness to the 
6455,White House. 
6456,Liability oj an Incumbent President to Criminal Prosecution . One 
6457,of the most difficult legal and policy questions WSPF faced was 
6458,whether to seek an indictment of President Nixon along with the in- 
6459,dictment of several of his former aides in connection with the Water- 
6460,"gate cover-up conspiracy. After careful deliberation, Special Prosecutor "
6461,Jaworski concluded that an indictment of President Nixon for such 
6462,"crimes would not be upheld by the Supreme Court, and that the "
6463,litigation leading to such an adverse decision would be prolonged and 
6464,might complicate the impeachment inquiry then underway in the 
6465,House of Representatives. Because of these conclusions and because 
6466,the evidence regarding President Nixon was clearly relevant to the 
6467,"House inquiry, the Special Prosecutor chose to ask the grand jury to "
6468,transmit an evidentiary report to the Committee considering the 
6469,President’s impeachment. 
6470,The Special Prosecutor’s conclusion about the President’s in- 
6471,"dictability was not easily reached, and the legal standard needs "
6472,"clarification. Should such a question arise in the future, it would be "
6473,helpful to know with more certainty whether the Constitution permits 
6474,"the indictment of an incumbent President, and if so, for what kinds of "
6475,"crimes, and what relationship such a prosecution has to the exercise "
6476,of Congress’ impeachment power. The worst time to answer such 
6477,"questions is when they arise; perhaps the best time is the present, "
6478,while the memory of relevant events is fresh. Congress should consider 
6479,these issues and clarify them by constitutional amendment. 
6480,Control of the Intelligence and National Security Functions 
6481,The executive branch of government exercises its greatest enforce- 
6482,ment powers when its agents identify persons or groups as a threat to 
6483,internal order or to the Nation’s security. Acting without court 
6484,"approval, law enforcement agencies can gather, store and use large "
6485,amounts of information about these persons and groups. These activi- 
6486,143
6487,"ties have been scrutinized, and are under scrutiny, by many orga- "
6488,"nizations— the Rockefeller Commission on CIA Activities, the Senate "
6489,and House Select Committees on Intelligence and subcommittees of 
6490,the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Since many of these 
6491,activities spanned two decades and others did not involve Presidential 
6492,"appointees or White House staff members, WSPF investigations "
6493,covered only part of these prior federal enforcement efforts. The 
6494,recommendations of the inquiry groups mentioned above should be 
6495,given immediate consideration by the executive and legislative 
6496,branches. The following two suggestions arose from WSPF’s work. 
6497,Policies Regarding the Intelligence Function. Much of what goes 
6498,"awry in intelligence functions can be laid to secret, subjective judg- "
6499,"ments about the establishment of priorities for intelligence-gathering, "
6500,"the selection of the kinds of information to be gathered, a failure to "
6501,analyze gathered information adequately and the stubborn failure 
6502,to reappraise decisions over time. The intelligence function should 
6503,be subject to the same policy procedures as any other important 
6504,government enterprise. 
6505,"Therefore, each agency with significant intelligence-gathering "
6506,"responsibilities, including the CIA, FBI, and IRS, should formulate "
6507,written policies that include the purposes for which intelligence is to 
6508,"be gathered, the methods to be used in obtaining information, the "
6509,"kinds of information to be sought, and provisions for periodic review "
6510,of priorities and purging of records that no longer serve an important 
6511,or legitimate purpose. 
6512,These policy statements should be submitted to a Presidentially- 
6513,appointed domestic intelligence policy review board that includes 
6514,agency heads and representatives of the public. The board would 
6515,hear the justifications for each policy and have the authority to make 
6516,public recommendations. 
6517,The general policy statements of each agency should be made 
6518,public. This can be accomplished without any threat to the effec- 
6519,tiveness of the intelligence function and can serve as guides for press 
6520,and citizen scrutiny of agency operations. 
6521,u National Security ” Exception to the Warrant Requirement for 
6522,"Searches and Seizures. In United States v. Ehrlichman , which charged "
6523,that the entry into the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist by the 
6524,White House “Plumbers” constituted a violation of the Fourth 
6525,"Amendment, the Special Prosecutor maintained both in the District "
6526,Court and in the Court of Appeals that interests of “national secur- 
6527,ity” cannot justify the lack of a judicially-authorized search warrant 
6528,"to enter a citizen’s home or office, in order to seize or copy documents. "
6529,Although the Special Prosecutor acknowledged that Attorneys 
6530,General in the past in foreign intelligence cases had authorized war- 
6531,"rantless physical trespasses to place electronic eavesdropping devices, "
6532,he argued that no Attorney General and no President had claimed 
6533,144
6534,"the constititional power to authorize or, in fact had authorized war- "
6535,rantless entries to seize documents from citizens. To WSPF's knowl- 
6536,"edge, that remains a fact. "
6537,"In the Court of Appeals, however, the Department of Justice filed "
6538,a brief stating the Department's view on “the legality of forms of 
6539,surveillance in the United States without a warrant in cases involving 
6540,foreign espionage or intelligence.” The brief continued: 
6541,It is the position of the Department of Justice that such activ- 
6542,ities must be very carefully controlled. There must be solid reason 
6543,to believe that foreign espionage or intelligence is involved. In 
6544,"addition, the intrusion into any zone of expected privacy must be "
6545,kept to the minimum and there must be personal authorization by 
6546,the President or the Attorney General. The United States be- 
6547,lieves that activities so controlled are lawful under the Fourth 
6548,Amendment. 
6549,In regard to warrantless searches related to foreign espionage 
6550,"or intelligence, the Department does not believe there is a con- "
6551,stitutional difference between searches conducted by wiretapping 
6552,and those involving physical entries into private premises. One 
6553,form of search is no less serious than another. It is and has long 
6554,been the Department's view that warrantless searches involving 
6555,physical entries into private premises are justified under the 
6556,proper circumstances when related to foreign espionage or intelli- 
6557,gence ...” 
6558,The Department's long-held “view” is based solely on policies 
6559,and authorized practices with regard to electronic surveillance and 
6560,is not based on any historical record involving authorized physical 
6561,"break-ins to seize tangible items. Moreover, in dealing with the "
6562,"Department on this matter, WSPF found that the historical record "
6563,even with respect to electronic surveillance is not entirely clear. 
6564,Attorneys General over the years have not always taken positions 
6565,"consistent with those of their predecessors, and there is no centralized, "
6566,complete record of prior practices and policies. 
6567,"This is obviously a matter of great public importance, affecting "
6568,not only basic constitutional rights but also the national security. 
6569,Although ultimately the courts must answer the constitutional 
6570,question — what power if any the President and his chief legal officer 
6571,(the Attorney General) have to authorize warrantless searches and 
6572,seizures in the name of national security — the current policy of the 
6573,executive should be subject to thorough Congressional and public 
6574,"scrutiny. Accordingly, it is recommended : "
6575,(a) Past memoranda setting forth the policy positions of the 
6576,"Presidents and Attorneys General should be disclosed publicly, and "
6577,(b) The Administration should promulgate publicly its current 
6578,"policy, stating the precise power claimed by the President and setting "
6579,forth in as great detail as possible the factors and standards that now 
6580,govern the President's and Attorney General's exercise of discretion 
6581,in authorizing warrantless foreign intelligence searches and seizures. 
6582,M5 
6583,Political Financing and Campaign Tactics 
6584,Campaign Financing and Reporting. WSPF’s experience in at- 
6585,"tempting to enforce the campaign financing and reporting laws, "
6586,"some newly enacted and others on the books for many years, suggests "
6587,that continuing enforcement efforts can be improved and that such 
6588,efforts would be aided by certain changes in the statutory require- 
6589,ments and prohibitions. 
6590,"1, Proactive Enforcement Policy. In many of WSPF’s election law "
6591,"investigations and prosecutions, defense counsel contended that there "
6592,had been a long history of non-enforcement of the applicable criminal 
6593,"statutes, and that the Special Prosecutor’s office should take that "
6594,history into account by deciding either that no charges should be 
6595,brought or that some mitigation of proposed charges would be appro- 
6596,priate. This argument had its greatest force with respect to the regis- 
6597,tration and reporting provisions of the universally criticized Federal 
6598,"Corrupt Practices Act, which has been repealed. Only one reported "
6599,"prosecution had ever been brought, in 1934/ and the Justice Depart- "
6600,"ment had long followed a policy, enunciated by Attorney General "
6601,"Herbert Brownell in 1954, of not initiating investigations except upon "
6602,referral by the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary 
6603,"of the Senate, the officials to whom reports were required to be made. "
6604,Such referrals rarely occurred. With respect to the prohibition against 
6605,"contributions by Government contractors (18 U.S.C. § 611), no re- "
6606,ported prosecutions had ever been brought. In the case of the prohibi- 
6607,tion against corporate or labor union contributions (18 U.S.C. § 610) 
6608,the record was somewhat better: a number of unions and union 
6609,"officials had been prosecuted, and some corporations had also been "
6610,"charged, but generally the individual corporate officers responsible "
6611,for the making of illegal contributions had not been charged. 
6612,It is important to the integrity of both law enforcement and the 
6613,electoral process that this history not be repeated. The Department of 
6614,Justice should use the resources and make the effort necessary to 
6615,monitor actively areas of possible abuse and begin investigations 
6616,without waiting for formal referrals or complaints. The Department 
6617,should announce its intent to pursue an aggressive policy of enforce- 
6618,ment of the election laws. To give further notice of such an enforcement 
6619,"policy, individual notices should be mailed to candidates for federal "
6620,"office, political committees and their officers, and corporations, labor "
6621,"unions, and their officers. "
6622,As a result of the 1974 amendments to the Federal Election Cam- 
6623,"paign Act, the Federal Elections Commission has a clear responsibility "
6624,to monitor and investigate campaign violations and make civil dis- 
6625,positions or refer criminal matters to the Department of Justice for 
6626,possible prosecution. The Commission presumably will discharge its 
6627,"3 U.S. v. Burroughs , 209 U.S. 534. "
6628,14$ 
6629,"duties responsibly and effectively, but the existence of the Commission "
6630,should not inhibit the development and promulgation of new Justice 
6631,"Department enforcement policies, particularly in view of the ongoing "
6632,legal challenges to the Commission’s own enforcement powers. 
6633,Vigorous enforcement efforts by the Justice Department would have 
6634,a marked deterrent effect on would-be violators of the election laws. 
6635,2. Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) 
6636,a. Reporting responsibility of the chairman of a political committee 
6637,under 2 U.S.C. § JSJ(a). This statute places sole responsibility for 
6638,filing reports of campaign receipts and expenditures on the treasurer 
6639,of a political committee. This approach tends to focus the law’s 
6640,requirements on a campaign official who often is not an important 
6641,figure in the committee hierarchy but merely acts as the chairman’s 
6642,agent. A committee chairman can therefore attempt to avoid respon- 
6643,sibility for his committee’s reporting violations by claiming that the 
6644,statute imposes no reporting duty on him. While the “aiding ancl 
6645,abetting” provisions of federal criminal law can be used under some 
6646,"circumstances to hold a chairman liable for such violations, the "
6647,treasurer-centered language of § 434(a) permits the raising of a false 
6648,issue which can mislead a court or jury. The statute should be amended 
6649,to place equal reporting responsibility on the chairman and treasurer 
6650,of a political committee. 
6651,"b. Penalty provisions of 2 U.S.C. § This section, establishing "
6652,"penalties for FECA violations, appears to pose an ambiguity. It "
6653,reads as follows: 
6654,§ 441. Penalties for violations 
6655,(a) Any person who violates any of the provisions of this 
6656,"chapter shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not "
6657,"more than one year, or both. "
6658,"(b) In case of any conviction under this chapter, where the "
6659,"punishment inflicted does not include imprisonment, such con- "
6660,viction shall be deemed a misdemeanor conviction only. 
6661,This language raised problems in . two cases brought by WSPF in 
6662,which defendants entered guilty pleas to misdemeanor FECA viola- 
6663,tions and then argued that Section (b) of the statute would not permit 
6664,the judge to sentence them to imprisonment. WSPF argued that the 
6665,statute permits a prison sentence for a misdemeanor and does not 
6666,create any felony designation. In neither case did the sentencing 
6667,"judge accept the defense contention. However, the statute should "
6668,"be amended to clarify Congress’ intent, and it is recommended that "
6669,§ 441(b) be eliminated as superfluous. 
6670,c. Statute of limitations: 2 U.S.C. § JJJ(a). The FECA was 
6671,amended in 1974 to require that any prosecution for violations of its 
6672,"provisions, and certain other criminal statutes dealing with campaign "
6673,"financing, be commenced within 3 years of the violation. Before the "
6674,"amendment, under both the FECA and its predecessor the Federal "
6675,147
6676,"Corrupt Practices Act, the period of limitation had been 5 years, as "
6677,"it is for almost all Federal crimes. It is often difficult, in dealing with "
6678,"“white-collar” crime generally, to uncover violations and bring "
6679,violators to indictment even within the normal 5-year period. The 
6680,"difficulty increases when campaign-law violators, including both "
6681,"givers and receivers of contributions, make efforts to conceal the "
6682,"illegal nature of their activities, as many did in the 1972 campaigns. "
6683,"Under such circumstances, with a 3-year statute of limitations, the "
6684,chances are excellent that many violations will be barred from prosecu- 
6685,tion by the time they are discovered. Another advantage of a 5-year 
6686,limitation period is that it permits a new Administration to prosecute 
6687,violations that might have occurred at any time during the previous 
6688,"Presidents last term of office, making it impossible for the previous "
6689,Administration to cover up its election violations and bar pursuit of 
6690,"those crimes by a new Administration circumscribed by the short, "
6691,3-year limitations. No convincing reasons have been advanced for 
6692,"granting this special privilege to Federal candidates, and the stat- "
6693,ute should be amended to readopt the 5-year period now applicable 
6694,to all other persons in the criminal code. 
6695,d . Intent-centered definitions in 2 U.S.C. § 481{e) and (/). The Act 
6696,requires the reporting of “contributions” and “expenditures” by 
6697,political committees; these subsections define those terms for re- 
6698,porting purposes as contributions or expenditures made “for the 
6699,"purpose of . . . influencing” nominations, primaries, or general "
6700,"elections. This definition seems unnecessarily narrow, permitting "
6701,campaign officials to contend that contributions received or ex- 
6702,penditures made after an election has taken place need not be re- 
6703,ported because they could not have been made with the requisite 
6704,"intent to influence the election. Similarly, it has been argued that the "
6705,campaign-fund expenditures that resulted in “hush-money” payments 
6706,to the Watergate defendants in 1972 were not reportable because they 
6707,were not made for the purpose of influencing the election. If the policy 
6708,behind the Act is to promote disclosure of the financial dealings of 
6709,"political campaign committees, the “definitions” section should be "
6710,amended to require that committees report all financial transactions 
6711,in which they engage (subject to the existing minimum dollar 
6712,"amounts), regardless of the purpose of the transaction or whether it "
6713,occurred before or after an election. 
6714,3. Solicitation and Receipt of Contributions in Federal Buildings 
6715,"{18 U.S.C. § 603). During the course of its investigations, the Cam- "
6716,paign Contributions Task Force learned of instances where members 
6717,of Congress or other Federal employees accepted voluntary campaign 
6718,contributions from private citizens in Federal Office buildings. This 
6719,"practice appears on its face to be prohibited by this felony statute, "
6720,"which, in essence, prohibits any person from soliciting or receiving a "
6721,"contribution in any Federal building. The statute’s legislative history, "
6722,148
6723,"however, indicates that it was intended to protect Federal civil "
6724,service employees from coercion and thus prohibit the solicitation or 
6725,receipt of contributions only from such employees. An}^ other inter- 
6726,pretation of the statute would give felony status to any person who 
6727,merely received campaign funds from any other person in a Federal 
6728,"building, even though the funds were unsolicited and neither person "
6729,"was a Government employee, when the identical conduct if performed "
6730,"a short distance away, i.e., on the sidewalk outside the building, would "
6731,involve no criminal act at all. 
6732,"On the basis of that legislative history, the Watergate Special "
6733,Prosecution Force declined to prosecute in those cases. Some might 
6734,argue that the solicitation or receipt of political contributions in 
6735,Federal buildings from non-Federal employees by elected Federal 
6736,"officials should be permitted, but there are strong policy considera- "
6737,tions which would support a prohibition against such action by ap- 
6738,"pointed Federal officials, such as cabinet officers or other executive "
6739,branch officials. 
6740,Because of this conflict between the plain meaning of the present 
6741,"statute and the legislative history of this Act, the statute should be "
6742,amended to state whether it does or does not apply only to contribu- 
6743,"tions to and from Federal employees, and to clarify the question of "
6744,its applicability to elected as well as appointed officials. 
6745,4. Contributions of Corporate or Union Funds Under 18 U.S.C. § 610 1 
6746,a. Designation of corporate violations as felony or misdemeanor . 
6747,"The amended statute imposes a fine of $25,000 for each violation by a "
6748,"corporation or labor union, but does not specify whether such a viola- "
6749,tion is a felony or misdemeanor. This omission sometimes leads to 
6750,confusion when a corporation or union pleads guilty to an information 
6751,"alleging a violation of § 610, and an individual is charged under 18 "
6752,"U.S.C. § 2 with causing, aiding, or abetting the violation. The absence "
6753,of a penalty of imprisonment for such conduct suggests that it is a 
6754,"misdemeanor, but the size of the maximum fine is reserved for the "
6755,felony classification defined elsewhere in the Federal criminal statutes. 
6756,Section 610 should be amended to designate a violation by a corpora- 
6757,tion or union as either a felony or a misdemeanor. 
6758,b. Definition of the term “ officer .” The section prohibits an officer 
6759,of a corporation or union from consenting to a contribution of cor- 
6760,"porate or union funds, but does not define the term “officer.” WSPF "
6761,"has taken the position, and a trial court has agreed in one case, that "
6762,the term applies to anyone who performs the managerial functions 
6763,"that an officer ordinarily would perform, regardless of title. But the "
6764,lack of a definition permits defendants in certain cases to argue that 
6765,the term applies only to individuals holding a position specifically 
6766,"entitled “officer” in the corporate charter or by-laws, or the laws of "
6767,the State of incorporation. A definition of “officer” should be added 
6768,149
6769,to Section 610 to include all corporate or union employees who per- 
6770,form the functions of an officer. 
6771,c. Definition of “ willful ” consent The section prohibits corporate 
6772,"or union officers, and campaign officials who receive contributions, "
6773,"from consenting to contributions of corporate or union funds, and "
6774,distinguishes between the misdemeanor of “consent” and the felony 
6775,of “willful consent.” WSPF has taken the position that “willful 
6776,consent” by a donor requires only the knowledge of the operative 
6777,facts and action taken with that knowledge which results in the making 
6778,"of an illegal contribution, rather than the affirmative knowledge "
6779,that the contribution is illegal. But that position has not been fully 
6780,tested in litigation and leaves open the question of what is a “non- 
6781,"willful” violation — i.e., what defenses of good faith or reliance on "
6782,advice of counsel will reduce the violation from a felony to a misde- 
6783,meanor. A related question is whether the language penalizing “non- 
6784,"willful” violations imposes a standard of strict liability, making a "
6785,corporate or union officer liable for consenting to a contribution even 
6786,"if he had no knowledge of its corporate or union source. Similarly, "
6787,in prosecuting recipients WSPF has taken the position that a “willful” 
6788,violation requires actual knowledge of a contribution’s corporate or 
6789,"union source, while a “non-willful” violation is established by reckless "
6790,disregard of the possibility that a contribution comes from such a 
6791,source. But it is possible to interpret the statute as one imposing 
6792,strict liability on recipients as well as donors. 
6793,A collateral question is whether there can be a conspiracy to 
6794,commit a “non-willful” § 610 violation. While one court in a case 
6795,unrelated to WSPF’s work has held that such a conspiracy can be 
6796,"charged, the basis for this finding is unclear in § 610. "
6797,Section 610 should be amended to claify the definitions of “willful” 
6798,"and “non-willful” conduct, preferably as WSPF has interpreted the "
6799,"terms, and to make clear whether a “non-willful” violation can be "
6800,the object of a conspiracy. 
6801,5. Contributions by Government Contractors Under 18 U.S.C. § 611 
6802,a. Nature of requisite contractual relationship. The statute prohibits 
6803,the giving of a campaign contribution by anyone who has entered 
6804,into a contract with the United States “either for the rendition of 
6805,"personal services or furnishing any material, supplies, or equipment "
6806,to the United States ... or for selling any land or building to the 
6807,"United States . . .,” if the contract payment includes funds appro- "
6808,priated by Congress. This language leaves open the question whether 
6809,a person or firm leasing property to the government is a contractor 
6810,within the statute’s meaning. Based on the section’s legislative his- 
6811,"tory, the Department of Justice has taken the position, to which "
6812,"WSPF has adhered, that such a person or firm is not a contractor "
6813,"under the section. However, that position seems inconsistent with "
6814,the statute’s general purpose of preventing improper influence on 
6815,150
6816,decisions about spending government funds. The section should be 
6817,amended to cover lessors of property along with other contractors. 
6818,b. Liability of individual 'partners in partnerships . Section 611 
6819,"applies to corporations, partnerships, and individuals — anyone "
6820,holding a contract with the government. Because a corporation is 
6821,"a separate entity from the individuals who own its stock, the Depart- "
6822,ment of Justice and WSPF have taken the position that shareholders 
6823,of corporations holding government contracts may make contributions 
6824,of funds they receive from corporate dividends without being in 
6825,"violation of § 611. Under the provisions of § 610, officers and employees "
6826,"of such a corporation also may contribute personal funds, including "
6827,"those derived from corporate dividends, to a political fund established "
6828,"to make campaign contributions with corporate identity. However, "
6829,because a partnership is not an entity separate from its individual 
6830,"partners, the Justice Department has taken the position that partners "
6831,may not make personal contributions if their partnership holds a 
6832,government contract. This leads to the anomalous situation in which 
6833,corporate shareholders and employees may contribute personal funds 
6834,either individually or jointly with corporate identity without being in 
6835,"violation of § 611, but members of a partnership which holds a govern- "
6836,ment contract are prohibited from giving similar support to the can- 
6837,didates of their choice. The statute should be amended to place 
6838,partners and corporate officers and shareholders of firms holding 
6839,government contracts on the same footing. 
6840,c. General scope of § 611 . The evident purpose of this section is to 
6841,prohibit the possible use of campaign contributions as a means of 
6842,influencing Government actions that affect potential contributors. But 
6843,its coverage is limited to potential donors having a contractual rela- 
6844,tionship with the Government. Other donors that do not necessarily 
6845,hold any Government contracts might have an equally if not more 
6846,"compelling interest in influencing Government action — for example, "
6847,airlines which depend on Government decisions about routes or oil 
6848,companies depending on Government decisions about import quotas. 
6849,"At the same time, § 611 is broad enough to include any person or firm "
6850,"having any contractual relationship with the Government, no matter "
6851,how small or insignificant that contract may be in the person’s or 
6852,"firm’s overall business. In enforcing §611, WSPF exercised its dis- "
6853,cretion to limit prosecutions under the statute to firms whose contracts 
6854,with the Government provided at least 20 percent of their gross 
6855,"receipts for the year in question, and it would seem reasonable to "
6856,amend the statute to narrow its coverage along those lines. At the 
6857,"same time, the statute should be redrafted to cover contributions by "
6858,persons or firms whose possible interest in improperly influencing 
6859,Government action is based on either contracts with the Government 
6860,"or other relationships, such as the regulated character of the person’s "
6861,or firm’s business. 
6862,151
6863,Such an amendment might also involve reduction of the disparity 
6864,"of penalties under both § 610 and § 611. As the law now stands, an "
6865,officer of a corporation with a substantial interest in Government reg- 
6866,"ulatory action, but with no contractual relationship, can be sentenced "
6867,to two years' imprisonment if he willfully consents to a contribution 
6868,"of corporate funds, while an individual holding a small contract with "
6869,the Government can be sentenced to five years' imprisonment for 
6870,making a personal contribution to any federal candidate. It might be 
6871,"appropriate to reduce the maximum penalty under § 611, while "
6872,broadening the statute's subject-matter coverage. A contribution 
6873,made for the purpose of influencing a Government action is already 
6874,subject to a bribery charge. 
6875,Questionable Campaign Practices . In addition to its inquiries into 
6876,"possible violations of campaign financing and reporting laws, WSPF "
6877,investigated allegations of other campaign activities generally known 
6878,"as “dirty tricks."" Many of these activities seemed clearly at odds "
6879,"with prevailing standards of acceptable campaign conduct, but did "
6880,not appear to be covered by existing federal criminal statutes. 4 As a 
6881,"result, the Senate Select Committee recommended legislation to pro- "
6882,hibit the following activities during political campaigns: 
6883,(1) obtaining or causing another to obtain employment in a 
6884,campaign by false pretenses in order to spy on or obstruct the 
6885,campaign; 
6886,(2) requesting or knowingly disbursing campaign funds for the 
6887,purpose of promoting or financing violations of election laws : 
6888,"(3) stealing, taking by false pretenses, or copying without authori- "
6889,zation campaign documents which are not available for public 
6890,dissemination; 
6891,(4) fradulently misrepresenting oneself as representing a candidate 
6892,"(applying to any person, not just candidates and their agents as in "
6893,§617). 
6894,"In addition, legislation has been introduced to prohibit any "
6895,payment to another person for actions that violate any election law 
6896,"(covering payments of campaign funds and funds from other sources), "
6897,and to make any violation of State or Federal law a separate Federal 
6898,offense if committed for the purpose of interfering with or affecting 
6899,the outcome of a Federal election. 
6900,"These proposals, designed to eliminate practices which are clearly "
6901,"disruptive of the political process, raise serious questions about the "
6902,proper role of the criminal justice system in policing day-to-day 
6903,campaign activities. There are stronger reasons for legislating against 
6904,"4 The Federal criminal code (18U.S.C. §§612, 617) prohibits publication or "
6905,"distribution of campaign literature without a designation of its true source, as "
6906,well as misrepresentation by a candidate or his agent that he is acting on behalf 
6907,of another candidate or campaign. 
6908,152
6909,corrupt campaign financing practices than for using criminal sanctions 
6910,to enforce standards of behavior during the heat of a political cam- 
6911,"paign. In the former instance, corruption is likely to influence not only "
6912,the outcome of the campaign but also decisions of elected officials on 
6913,"matters of interest to their contributors; by contrast, “dirty tricks” "
6914,"perpetrated during a campaign have, at most, only a temporary "
6915,"effect, if any. "
6916,Several other considerations complicate the question of whether to 
6917,"outlaw “dirty tricks” not encompassed by existing legislation. First, "
6918,the criminal justice system is not a desirable watch-dog over the 
6919,daily operations of political campaigns. Proper enforcement efforts 
6920,would produce a tremendous drain on law enforcement resources and 
6921,"could inhibit the legitimate activities of candiates and their supporters, "
6922,"as well as create dangers of prosecutorial misconduct . 5 In addition, "
6923,many “dirty tricks” are exposed during the course of a political 
6924,"campaign, to the detriment of the candidate on whose behalf they are "
6925,conducted. The experience of WSPF also suggests that most cam- 
6926,"paign “pranksters” are persons who, because of their youthful in- "
6927,"experience, fail to appreciate the nature of their conduct. Finally, "
6928,there is the problem of defining prohibited conduct in this area so as 
6929,"to give adequate notice to potential offenders, while at the same time "
6930,avoiding infringement on the First Amendment rights of candidates 
6931,and their supporters. 
6932,All these considerations suggest the wisdom of keeping criminal 
6933,prohibitions to a minimum. Both the Constitution and the nation’s 
6934,experience as a democracy suggest that broad criminal restraints on 
6935,"political activity and expression are unnecessary and unwise. Even so, "
6936,"some reforms are desirable. In terms of the criminal law, it might be "
6937,"advisable to prohibit the copying, stealing or taking by false pretenses "
6938,of campaign documents not available to the public . 6 
6939,The suggestion that campaign “dirty tricks” be dealt with chiefly 
6940,by the political process is based also on the theory that the recently 
6941,"created Federal Election Commission, if given expanded powers, "
6942,would be able to detect and expose improper campaign practices. The 
6943,Commission is presently empowered to receive complaints and conduct 
6944,5 Since Federal prosecutors are appointed by the President and must be 
6945,"confirmed by the Senate, the integrity of their decision making processes in this "
6946,area might well be questioned as motivated by political considerations or pressure 
6947,on the part of those who supported their appointment. 
6948,"6 Since such documents usually have no intrinsic monetary value, they are "
6949,"not protected by state laws relating to theft; rather, they are akin to documents "
6950,containing proprietary information or “trade secrets” which are protected under 
6951,"the laws of some states. In considering the advisability of such legislation, how- "
6952,"ever, Congress should careful^ weigh its First Amendment implications, including "
6953,its possible effect on persons who disclose documents revealing matters of legiti- 
6954,"mate concern to voters, such as a candidate’s improper actions or inconsistencies "
6955,between his private views and public statements. 
6956,153
6957,"investigations of alleged violations of § 617, as well as transgressions of "
6958,campaign financing laws. The Commission's authority should be 
6959,broadened to include investigation of violations of § 612 and of any 
6960,other legal prohibitions enacted in the future as to campaign tactics. 
6961,The Commission should also be empowered to adopt standards of 
6962,campaign conduct to define what behavior is not acceptable in political 
6963,"campaigns, and to enforce such standards through its investigative "
6964,"powers, its authority to assess civil penalties, and its authority to "
6965,issue public reports describing instances or patterns of misconduct in 
6966,particular campaigns. 
6967,* * * * 
6968,"One final note, albeit a personal one. One hundred years ago, an "
6969,America still recovering from its devastating Civil War wrestled with 
6970,the pay-off scandals of the Grant Administration tod approached 
6971,its centennial celebration. Historians report that few candidates 
6972,reached the United States Senate without financial support from the 
6973,"“special ’interests” — railroads, oil companies, textile concerns, the "
6974,iron and steel industry and mining companies. 7 The Nation had grown 
6975,so weary that even the usually optimistic Longfellow wrote: 
6976,"Ah, woe is me "
6977,I hoped to see my country rise to heights 
6978,Of happiness and freedom }^et unreached 
6979,"By other nations, but the climbing wave "
6980,"Pauses, lets go its hold, and slides again "
6981,"Back to the common level, with a hoarse "
6982,Death-rattle in its throat. I am too old 
6983,To hope for better days. 
6984,"Now again, at the Bicentennial, the Nation has grown wear y^ "
6985,"Much contributed to this, but few can deny that uncovering years "
6986,of actual and alleged Government abuses has played its part. Institu- 
6987,tions once again had to earn the faith of the people in whose names 
6988,they acted. 
6989,"That lesson became clear. When Archibald Cox was fired, Ameri- "
6990,cans rose in anger. The telegrams came to us from Middle America — 
6991,"small cities, towns, and hamlets that only the residents had ever "
6992,heard of. The national Government had offended its people's sense 
6993,"of justice. The citizens wanted to control what would happen, and "
6994,"they eventually did. When vigilance erupted, institutions responded. "
6995,"One must believe that unresponsive power, both public and private, "
6996,can never overcome that will.

6998,Oxford History of the American People. 731-3 (Oxford University Press 1965).

7804,Appendix B: 
7805,Organizational 
7806,History 
7807,This appendix is a narrative of events leading up to the formation 
7808,"of the Special Prosecutor's office in the spring of 1973, the organization "
7809,"of the office, and its eventual abolition and re-establishment, all within "
7810,a 5 -month period. 
7811,BACKGROUND TO THE APPOINTMENT OF 
7812,THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR 
7813,By the spring of 1973 there were strong indications that “Water- 
7814,gate” involved more than the “third-rate burglary” described by a 
7815,White House spokesman. The press had linked high officials of the 
7816,Committee to Re-Elect the President with the break-in and had 
7817,uncovered facts which suggested that the White House and other 
7818,"Federal agencies had engaged in such activities as political espionage, "
7819,"break-ins, obstruction of justice and irregularities in campaign "
7820,"financing. In short, a trail of misdeeds seemed to lead directly to the "
7821,White House. 
7822,Although the President and the then Attorney General insisted 
7823,"that the original Watergate investigation had been exhaustive, a "
7824,number of circumstances caused increasing suspicion that much more 
7825,probing was necessary : 
7826,"— In late February and early March, Acting FBI Director L. Pat- "
7827,rick Gray revealed that the Bureau had investigated little other than 
7828,the break-in itself and had not pursued other allegations. 
7829,"— In March, one of the defendants, James McCord, wrote a letter "
7830,to Judge Sirica alleging a “cover-up” of incidents surrounding the 
7831,break-in. He charged that persons yet unnamed were involved in the 
7832,"case, that perjury had been committed at the trial of the burglars, and "
7833,that political pressure had been applied to the defendants to induce 
7834,them to plead guilty and remain silent. 
7835,"— On April 15, Attorney General Richard Kleindienst disqualified "
7836,himself from the investigation because of his close personal and pro- 
7837,fessional relationship with persons under suspicion. 
7838,171
7839,"— On April 30, White House Press Secretary Ronald Ziegler an- "
7840,"nounced the resignations of Haldeman and Ehrlichman, and the firing "
7841,"of Dean. In the same announcement, he revealed that Kleindienst "
7842,"had resigned and had been replaced by the Secretary of Defense, "
7843,Elliot Richardson. 
7844,"That evening, in a television address to the Nation, President "
7845,Nixon said that he had given Richardson absolute authority over 
7846,"the Watergate case and related matters, including the authority to "
7847,name a special prosecutor if he considered it appropriate to do so. 
7848,"In the week that followed, several resolutions calling for the ap- "
7849,pointment of a special prosecutor were introduced in the Congress. 
7850,Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee (who were about to 
7851,consider Richardson’s nomination as Attorney General) privately 
7852,pressed him for an assurance that he would appoint a special prose- 
7853,cutor. Some Senators even said publicly that Richardson’s confirma- 
7854,"tion would depend on such an appointment. On May 7, Richardson "
7855,"announced that, if confirmed, he would appoint a special prosecutor. "
7856,"The next day Senator Adlai Stevenson, III, introduced a resolution, "
7857,"cosponsored by 23 Democrats, which set forth terms designed to "
7858,guarantee the independence and authority of a special prosecutor. 
7859,"ESTABLISHING THE JURISDICTION, "
7860,AUTHORITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR 
7861,"Richardson’s confirmation hearings, which began on May 9, "
7862,focused on the terms in the Stevenson resolution he would guarantee 
7863,and the jurisdiction he would give to the special prosecutor. As to 
7864,"jurisdiction, Richardson testified that he would delegate responsibility "
7865,over the following: 
7866,"1. All cases arising out of the 1972 Presidential election campaign, "
7867,"including the Watergate break-in case, the Donald Segretti case "
7868,(Segretti had been charged on May 4 in Florida with fabricating and 
7869,distributing a letter damaging to three Democratic presidential candi- 
7870,"dates), and violations of campaign laws; "
7871,2. Cover-up conspiracies and misuse of high Government offices; 
7872,3. The burglary of the office of the psychiatrist of antiwar activist 
7873,Daniel Ellsberg; and 
7874,"4. Procrastination or obfuscation by the Department of Justice, "
7875,"the FBI, or any other agency relating to the cover-up of these cases. "
7876,Richardson pointed out that the common denominator of the 
7877,special prosecutor’s jurisdiction would be allegations of involvement 
7878,"of White House or CRP officials, or Administration appointees. He "
7879,said he intended to leave the assignment open in order to delegate 
7880,"matters which at the outset did not seem to be related to Watergate, "
7881,but which might later prove to be so related. He added that he did 
7882,172
7883,not know enough at that time about the milk fund case or the Vesco 
7884,"case to decide whether they should be included, and said that he would "
7885,deal later with the question of delegating responsibility to investigate 
7886,various other activities of the White House “Plumbers.” 
7887,Richardson was equally explicit in his testimony about the author- 
7888,"ity of the special prosecutor. The special prosecutor, he stated, would "
7889,have the necessary financial support to do the job and full authority to 
7890,select a staff and to exercise the powers normally vested in the As- 
7891,sistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division . 1 In the 
7892,"latter connection, Richardson testified that the special prosecutor "
7893,would be empowered to decide what kind of relationship he would 
7894,have with various U.S. Attorneys investigating matters under his 
7895,"jurisdiction, including the right to overrule a U.S. Attorney, to inter- "
7896,"vene at any phase of proceedings being conducted, to dismiss any "
7897,indictments already brought and to bring more serious charges if he 
7898,deemed it appropriate. 
7899,Richardson further stated that he intended to give the special 
7900,prosecutor complete authority to challenge claims of executive privi- 
7901,lege (including the right to seek court review ) 2 and assertions of the 
7902,right to withhold information on national security grounds. Richardson 
7903,also testified that the special prosecutor would have the authority to 
7904,determine if and when to seek a court order granting immunity to a 
7905,witness . 3 
7906,The question of the special prosecutor's “independence” was more 
7907,"difficult. On the one hand, Richardson assured the Committee that "
7908,the special prosecutor would not be removed from office except for 
7909,"malfeasance or gross incompetence. On the other hand, Richardson "
7910,was faced with the legal obligations which he would assume if con- 
7911,firmed as Attorney General. The Stevenson resolution called for the 
7912,appointment of a special prosecutor with “final” authority. Richard- 
7913,son objected to the use of the word “final”; he felt that statutes giving 
7914,the responsibility for the administration of the Department of Justice 
7915,to the Attorney General required that the Attorney General retain 
7916,ultimate authority. While he said he would delegate “full” authority 
7917,"to the special prosecutor, he took the position that he would exercise "
7918,his ultimate authority only if the special prosecutor was “behaving 
7919,arbitrarily or capriciously.” Richardson stressed that he would not 
7920,1 Richardson also assured the Committee that he would request the Justice 
7921,Department and the FBI to detail personnel to the special prosecutor’s office. 
7922,2 Since the President’s Counsel would represent the White House in such liti- 
7923,"gation, Richardson said he would not exercise the traditional role of the Attorney "
7924,General to interpret the applicability of the doctrine of executive privilege. 
7925,"3 By law (18 U.S.C. § 6003), any request by a Federal prosecutor to a court "
7926,"for an immunity order must be approved by the Attorney General, Deputy "
7927,Attorney General or designated Assistant Attorney General. Richardson said he 
7928,intended to give approval automatically to any such requests by the special 
7929,prosecutor. 
7930,173
7931,interpose his judgment over the special prosecutor's in such discre- 
7932,"tionary matters as whether to request a grant of immunity, whether "
7933,"to seek an indictment and, if so, on what charges, or whether to take "
7934,the prosecutorial responsibility out of the hands of a U.S. Attorney. 
7935,It was Richardson's view that he would be available to consult with 
7936,"the special prosecutor, that he would give whatever advice he could "
7937,"and would want to be kept generally informed, but that the special "
7938,prosecutor would not be under any obligation to keep him informed 
7939,or to seek his approval in advance of a prosecutive decision. 
7940,Richardson thought the likelihood of his intervention was so 
7941,"remote as to be practically inconceivable. If it occurred, he said, it "
7942,would be due to arbitrary action either by the special prosecutor or 
7943,"himself; if the latter were true, the special prosecutor would have a "
7944,duty to make the situation known immediately. Richardson further 
7945,assured the Committee of his support for a full and thorough investiga- 
7946,"tion and suggested that, at some subsequent stage when the special "
7947,"prosecutor had substantially completed his job, a panel might be "
7948,created to review the whole record of the special prosecutor's activities. 
7949,SELECTION OF ARCHIBALD COX 
7950,AS SPECIAL PROSECUTOR 
7951,On the first day of the hearings Richardson announced that he had 
7952,"consulted 80 to 100 individuals, including the presidents of the Ameri- "
7953,"can Bar Association and the American College of Trial Lawyers, and "
7954,had asked them to submit names for the position of special prosecutor. 
7955,"He said he would draw up a list, submit it to certain individuals for "
7956,further comment and then adopt an order in which to approach the 
7957,persons recommended. He asked the Judiciary Committee to invite 
7958,the candidate to testify and promised that he would select another if 
7959,"the Committee or the full Senate, by resolution, did not approve his "
7960,choice. 
7961,Richardson was asked and agreed to submit the “finalists” list to 
7962,members of the Committee for their comment. He did so after narrow- 
7963,"ing the list to four persons. On May 15, he announced that the first "
7964,person on the list was then examining the guidelines drawn up to 
7965,describe the special prosecutor's authority and responsibilities. He 
7966,told the Committee that he anticipated incorporating suggestions 
7967,from the candidate and promised to let them know if the top persons 
7968,turned down the job because they felt there was insufficient flexibility 
7969,in the guidelines. 
7970,"Later that day Richardson's first choice, U.S. District Judge "
7971,"Harold Tyler of New York, declined the job. He told, the press he "
7972,"thought it would be wrong to resign his judgeship, particularly in "
7973,light of the fact that the ground rules were not completely settled. 
7974,174
7975,Richardson said he would confer with the remaining candidates before 
7976,"offering the post to anyone. The next day, Warren Christopher, a "
7977,California attorney and former Deputy Attorney General of the 
7978,"United States, removed himself from consideration after conferring "
7979,with Richardson. He announced that he had done so because he 
7980,would not have been granted enough independence. 
7981,On May 17 Richardson sent the guidelines for the special prose- 
7982,"cutor’s job to the Judiciary Committee to clarify his position, as "
7983,refined by the hearings and his interviews with the candidates for 
7984,special prosecutor. He pledged that he would not countermand or 
7985,interfere with the special prosecutor’s decisions or actions and would 
7986,not remove the special prosecutor except for extraordinary impro- 
7987,prieties. He also announced that he was adding ten names to the list 
7988,of candidates. 
7989,On May 18 Richardson announced that if the Senate approved 
7990,his own nomination he would appoint Archibald Cox to be the Special 
7991,Prosecutor. Cox was a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law 
7992,School and had served as Solicitor General of the United States. A 
7993,final version of Richardson’s guidelines — amended to specify that the 
7994,Special Prosecutor would determine whether and to what extent he 
7995,would inform or consult with the Attorney General about the conduct 
7996,of his duties and responsibilities — was presented to the Committee 
7997,that day. In a separate announcement Cox said he was satisfied that 
7998,Richardson’s guidelines would permit sufficient independence to do 
7999,the job right. He said that he had studied these guidelines and was 
8000,satisfied that they gave him all the formal power he needed. As further 
8001,"insurance, Cox agreed to keep a detailed record of his conversations "
8002,"with Richardson and to make a full final report of his work, including "
8003,factual findings as to high Government officials. Cox said he considered 
8004,"that the “full” authority vested in him was, for all practical purposes, "
8005,"“final,” and suggested that the only authority Richardson was re- "
8006,taining was “to give me hell if I do not do the job.” 
8007,"On May 23, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted unanimously "
8008,to recommend the confirmation of Elliot Richardson. He was con- 
8009,firmed that same day by the full Senate and was sworn in as Attorney 
8010,General on May 25. Several hours later Cox was sworn in as Special 
8011,Prosecutor. 
8012,ORGANIZATION OF THE 
8013,WATERGATE SPECIAL PROSECUTION FORCE 
8014,On May 31 Richardson issued an order establishing WSPF and 
8015,setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Special Prosecutor. 
8016,"He designated Cox as Director of the office and directed all divisions, "
8017,"offices, services and bureaus of the Department of Justice, including "
8018,17S 
8019,"the FBI and U.S. Attorneys, to cooperate with the Special Prosecutor "
8020,"on all matters under his jurisdiction, 4 "
8021,After Cox had familiarized himself with the factual matters falling 
8022,"within his purview, he met with the Attorney General and Henry "
8023,"Petersen, the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, "
8024,to clarify which investigations that the Criminal Division had been 
8025,handling were encompassed by this mandate. They decided : 
8026,—That the Special Prosecutor would be responsible for all cases 
8027,arising out of the Vesco indictments already returned by the grand 
8028,"jury in the Southern District of New York, but that the Criminal "
8029,"Division, under the supervision of the Special Prosecution Force, "
8030,would be responsible for the extradition of Vesco; 
8031,— That the indictment returned by the Middle District of Florida 
8032,against Donald Segretti and all cases of campaign violations arising 
8033,out of the activities of Segretti would be the responsibility of the 
8034,Special Prosecutor; 
8035,— That the Criminal Division would prepare an inventory of all 
8036,election law cases and investigations then pending with respect to 
8037,the 1972 Presidential campaign and those Senatorial and Congres- 
8038,sional campaigns arguably related to matters within the Special 
8039,Prosecutor’s jurisdiction ; the Special Prosecutor would then designate 
8040,from the inventor those matters over which he would assume total 
8041,or supervisory responsibility ; 
8042,— That the Special Prosecutor would be responsible for all matters 
8043,relating to the burglary of the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist; 
8044,— That allegations related to the Presidential commutation of

8048,any criminal violations in the Department of Justice’s settlement of an 
8049,antitrust case against the International Telephone and Telegraph 
8050,Company (ITT); this included possible perjury in testimony before 
8051,"the Senate Judiciary Committee relating to that settlement, and the "
8052,Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) referral to the Justice 
8053,Department of an allegation that ITT had obstructed an SEC investi- 
8054,gation by failing to turn over all relevant documents sought under an 
8055,SEC subpoena; 5 and 
8056,4 The full jurisdiction of WSPF is contained in the charter documents included 
8057,below in Appendix J. 
8058,5 In June 1972 the Senate Judiciary Committee had referred its transcripts 
8059,of the hearings on the nomination of Richard Klein dienst to be Attorney General — 
8060,during which much testimony about the ITT antitrust settlement had been 
8061,given — to the Justice Department for investigation of possible peijury. Shortly 
8062,"thereafter the SEC had referred its subpoena question to Justice, The investiga- "
8063,tion of these matters had not been completed in June 1973. On June 7 Richardson 
8064,had asked Cox to take responsibility for the whole matter. Cox had agreed and 
8065,Richardson had so notified the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
8066,17 $ 
8067,— That the Special Prosecutor would investigate allegations of 
8068,contributions to the President’s campaign by the Lehigh Valley 
8069,Dairy Association in return for assistance in matters affecting the 
8070,Association . 6 
8071,Cox realized that he must organize his office so that it could address 
8072,new and developing allegations as well as assimilate quickly the vast 
8073,amount of information which had already been uncovered in matters 
8074,falling under his jurisdiction. He selected two colleagues from Harvard 
8075,"Law School — Philip Heymann, who had worked for Cox when Cox "
8076,"was Solicitor General, and James Vorenberg, who had served as "
8077,Executive Director of the President’s Commission on Law Enforce- 
8078,ment and Administration of Justice 7 — to help him undertake these 
8079,"tasks. In their first days at WSPF, they resolved organizational details "
8080,"with the Attorney General, and established an operating relationship "
8081,with the Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the District of Columbia who 
8082,"were working on the Watergate investigation, with the Assistant U.S. "
8083,Attorneys for the Southern District of New York who were handling 
8084,"the Vesco case, and with the FBI. They attempted in the first few days "
8085,to delay public hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Presi- 
8086,"dential Campaign Activities and to obtain an inventory, and prevent "
8087,"any possible removal, of documents in the White House files which "
8088,might be useful to the investigations. During this early period they 
8089,also recruited staff and supervised the physical establishment of an 
8090,office. 
8091,"Cox wanted the WSPF staff to be independent, professional and "
8092,"non-partisan. He felt this was, necessary to instill confidence in the "
8093,public that all allegations would be evaluated objectively and invest- 
8094,igated fully and to instill confidence in potential witnesses that their 
8095,evidence would be weighed seriously and would not be relayed to the 
8096,Justice Department or to the White House. Although “administra- 
8097,6 It was decided that the Criminal Division (1) would handle two investigations 
8098,already well underway in that Division; (2) would handle the civil cases Ellsberg v. 
8099,"Mitchell and Halperin v. Kissinger , charging illegal wiretapping, and would make "
8100,available to the Special Prosecutor all pleadings before they were filed in the 
8101,cases; and (3) would answer defense allegations in U.S . v. Briggs and U.S . v. 
8102,Ayers that illegal methods had been used by the White House or the President’s 
8103,campaign committee to obtain evidence against the defendants and would send 
8104,to the Special Prosecutor copies of all investigative requests to the FBI relating 
8105,to these allegations and any information thereby developed by the FBI which 
8106,related to matters within the Special Prosecutor’s jurisdiction. In return the 
8107,Special Prosecutor would send to the Criminal Division any information he 
8108,developed bearing on these allegations. It was further decided that the Tax Divi- 
8109,sion of the Justice Department would continue to handle potential gift tax viola- 
8110,tions in connection with political contributions and would advise the Special 
8111,Prosecutor of violations i elated to matters within his jurisdiction. 
8112,"7 Stephen Breyer, another Harvard colleague, also joined WSPF for the sum- "
8113,mer to help organize the ITT Task Force. 
8114,177
8115,"tively” his office was part of the Justice Department, he wanted it "
8116,to function as a separate agency. No one from the Justice Department 
8117,who had had any prior connection with cases within WSPF's juris- 
8118,diction or with the White House was hired. Any employee hired from 
8119,the Department was formally transferred to the staff of the Special 
8120,Prosecution Force. Cox early decided to establish his own press office 
8121,rather than to use the Public Information Office of the Department 
8122,to handle press contacts. 
8123,"As soon as Cox's appointment was announced, a large number of "
8124,"applications came into his office. By estimate, more than 1,000 appli- "
8125,cations or expressions of interest came to the new office's attention 
8126,"in the first few weeks. Vorenberg reviewed these and, to fill the senior "
8127,"positions, Cox and be solicited recommendations and evaluations from "
8128,"judges, prosecutors and practicing lawyers. The need to build up "
8129,a staff quickly required that applicants be available to begin work 
8130,immediately. A number of those finally selected were known to Cox 
8131,or Vorenberg through professional or school associations. 
8132,From the beginning it seemed clear that the Special Prosecutor's 
8133,assignments fell into logical divisions and that the office could be 
8134,"organized into “task forces” along those lines. At the same time, "
8135,"because of certain similarities in the areas of investigation, it was "
8136,recognized that a task force might turn up information of peripheral 
8137,value which might be significant to another task force's work. Cox 
8138,anticipated that central coordination and frequent contact among 
8139,the task forces could minimize the possibility that such information 
8140,would be neglected. In the first few weeks Vorenberg had principal 
8141,responsibility for this coordination function which was seen as a pri- 
8142,mary function of the person who would become Deputy Special 
8143,Prosecutor. 
8144,"James Neal, a criminal defense lawyer who had served as U.S. "
8145,"Attorney in Tennessee, joined the staff on May 29 to head a task force "
8146,investigating the Watergate break-in and cover-up. He spent the first 
8147,few weeks at the District of Columbia U.S. Attorney's office working 
8148,with the Assistant U.S. Attorneys who had been handling that case. 
8149,Other early recruits were hired without specific assignments desig- 
8150,"nated for them. Thomas McBride, a former prosecutor and criminal "
8151,"justice administrator, also joined on May 29. He was asked to gather "
8152,information about several other areas of investigation. He met with 
8153,the Assistant U.S. Attorneys handling the Vesco case and with attor- 
8154,neys from the Criminal Division who were investigating 1972 Presi- 
8155,dential campaign contribution reporting violations. He shortly took 
8156,over responsibility for the Campaign Contributions Task Force. 
8157,Heymann worked with Neal on the Watergate investigation and then 
8158,shifted to reviewing evidence of illegal activities by the White House 
8159,"Plumbers Unit. James Doyle, a national reporter for the Washington "
8160,"Star News , was hired to head the press office. "
8161,178
8162,Thirty days after Cox took office the staff numbered approxi- 
8163,"mately 33 persons, including 21 lawyers. By late June, Cox and Neal "
8164,became concerned that the lawyers on hand would not be able to 
8165,assimilate the mass of information being provided daily in testimony 
8166,before the Senate Select Committee and other Congressional com- 
8167,mittees. Consequently ten recent law school graduates were hired 
8168,and assigned to summarize the Congressional committee transcripts. 
8169,"In addition, Harry Bratt, a career Government administrator with "
8170,"background in computer usage, was hired to study the possibility of "
8171,computerizing the growing volume of information. 
8172,Henry Ruth joined the staff as Deputy Special Prosecutor on 
8173,"July 2. Ruth, a former prosecutor from the Justice Department’s "
8174,"Organized Crime Section, had later served as Deputy Director of the "
8175,"Crime Commission, and in 1973 was Director of the New York City "
8176,"Criminal Justice Coordinating Council. As Deputy, Ruth was to "
8177,supervise the investigations closely and to coordinate the work of the 
8178,task forces. 
8179,"Also on July 2, Philip Lacovara, then Deputy Solicitor General "
8180,"of the United States, joined the staff as Counsel to the Special "
8181,Prosecutor. 
8182,"By mid-July, William Merrill, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney "
8183,"from Michigan, had been assigned to head the investigation of the "
8184,"“Plumbers” activities; Joseph Connolly, an attorney from Phila- "
8185,"delphia, was designated as head of the ITT Task Force; and Richard "
8186,"Davis, a prosecutor from the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern "
8187,"District of New York, was placed in charge of the investigation of "
8188,Segretti’s activities and other campaign “dirty tricks.” (Later in the 
8189,summer Davis took over joint responsibility with Connolly for the 
8190,"ITT Task Force.) In late July, on Bratt’s recommendation, Cox "
8191,approved the establishment of a computerized Information Section 
8192,to provide the capability for comparing discrepancies in testimony and 
8193,for completely cross-referencing subjects and persons mentioned in 
8194,testimony. The lawyers of the Information Section were assigned to 
8195,other positions in the office and a paralegal staff was hired and trained 
8196,for the computer operation. 8 
8197,"By the middle of summer 1973, five task forces were in operation. "
8198,By early September there were 42 lawyers (including four consultants) 
8199,and 44 other staff members at WSPF. Although there was some staff 
8200,turnover during the following 18 months and some refinements in the 
8201,"original organizational plan, the office continued with this general "
8202,"structure throughout its tenure, with the abandonment of a task force "
8203,only upon completion of its work. The office had its highest number 
8204,of employees in August 1974 when there were 95 staff members. 
8205,An organizational chart of the office is shown on page 181. 
8206,8 The work of the Information Section is described in Appendix H.

8208,DISMISSAL OF COX; 
8209,ABOLITION AND RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF WSPF 
8210,The events leading up to the firing of Cox and abolition of WSPF 
8211,are set out in Chapter 4 of the principal report. This section describes 
8212,the period immediately following Cox’s firing. 
8213,"After Acting Attorney General Bork fired Cox, General Haig, "
8214,"of the White House Staff, directed Clarence Kelley, Director of the "
8215,"FBI, to send agents to the WSPF office on the evening of October 20 "
8216,to prevent removal of any documents. Agents were also dispatched 
8217,to the Attorney General’s and the Deputy Attorney General’s offices. 
8218,"For approximately 16 hours, from 9:05 p.m., on October 20, 1973, "
8219,"to 12:47 p.m. on October 21, 1973 — agents of the Federal Bureau "
8220,of Investigation occupied the offices of WSPF. Although official docu- 
8221,"ments could not be removed, the most important and sensitive docu- "
8222,ments had been copied earlier in the week after White House counsel 
8223,Charles Alan Wright hinted in an October 18 letter to Special Prose- 
8224,cutor Cox that if Cox refused to agree to White House compromise 
8225,"proposals on access to Presidential tape recordings, “we will have to "
8226,follow the course of action that we think in the best interest of the 
8227,country.” Task force leaders and other senior staff members then re- 
8228,"moved copies of certain items from the office, replacing them when "
8229,Judge John J. Sirica signed a protective order covering the files on 
8230,October 26. Copies of documents of a particularly sensitive nature 
8231,were placed in two safe-deposit boxes in nearby banks. 
8232,"On the Saturday night of Cox’s firing, the Special Prosecutor’s "
8233,staff immediately reported to the office. One of their main concerns 
8234,"was to secure files from anyone who might want to, or be ordered to,, "
8235,read or destroy the files. Since the FBI agent in charge did not have 
8236,written instructions of his responsibilities and since he said he did 
8237,"not have authority to approve any movement of files within the office, "
8238,"Deputy Special Prosecutor Ruth contacted Henry Petersen, Assist- "
8239,ant Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the Justice De- 
8240,"partment, and received approval to gather the most sensitive papers "
8241,and place them in front office file safes to which only a few WSPF 
8242,personnel had the combinations. Ruth also advised Petersen that an 
8243,important witness was scheduled to testify before the grand jury the 
8244,following Tuesday and Petersen agreed that that appointment should 
8245,be kept. Bork gave assurances that the Special Prosecutor’s employees 
8246,were not fired but were to be made employees of the Criminal Division. 
8247,The staff was advised of these telephone calls and agreed not to take 
8248,any precipitous action until they had a better understanding of the 
8249,situation. Around midnight they left the office.

8259,"Sometime in the morning hours of October 21, the Justice Depart- "
8260,ment ordered U.S. Marshals to replace the FBI agents occupying 
8261,the WSPF offices. The marshals arrived at 12:47 p.m. that day. 
8262,"The next day, a holiday, the staff gathered at the office to assess "
8263,the situation. Bork announced that Petersen was now in charge of the 
8264,investigation. That evening Ruth and Lacovara met with Bork and 
8265,Petersen to discuss the operational relationship between WSPF and 
8266,the Criminal Division. Ruth agreed to bring each task force to meet 
8267,with Petersen. Ruth and Lacovara then returned to the office and 
8268,briefed the staff on the meeting; the staff discussed alternatives and 
8269,reached no firm conclusions about what it should do. 
8270,On Tuesday morning Judge Sirica assured the grand juries that 
8271,they could rely on the court to safeguard their rights and preserve the 
8272,integrity of their proceedings. He also scheduled a court hearing on 
8273,the Presidential tapes at 2 p.m. that day. At the hearing Wright 
8274,"announced that he was not prepared to file a response, but was "
8275,authorized to say that the President would comply in all respects 
8276,with the court orders. Shortly thereafter Haig announced withdrawal 
8277,of the offer of summaries of the tapes to the Senate Select Committee. 9 
8278,"That same day Bork issued a written order, effective as of October "
8279,"21, abolishing the Watergate Special Prosecution Force and returning "
8280,its functions to the Criminal Division. During the next few days 
8281,Bork and Petersen met several times 'with Ruth and Lacovara and 
8282,met once with the full senior staff of the office. Petersen and his 
8283,assistant John Keene}^ met with task forces investigating ITT and 
8284,"dairy contributions, and the next week met with the task force "
8285,investigating the break-in of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office. 
8286,On October 24 Bork announced that the White House had agreed 
8287,there should be “regularized procedures” for turning over evidence 
8288,"to the Watergate prosecutors. During that week and the next, draft "
8289,letters to the White House asking for various records were sent by 
8290,several task forces to Petersen for his consideration and Petersen 
8291,arid Bork were briefed by Ruth on past difficulties the office had 
8292,encountered in trying to get documents from the White House. 
8293,On October 25 Petersen joined the senior staff in a petition to 
8294,the District Court for a protective order prohibiting the removal of 
8295,any grand jury records from the office except by the staff in the 
8296,„ course of. their work. This request was granted by Judge Sirica the 
8297,next day; he assigned the General Services Administration the 
8298,responsibility for ensuring nonremoval. 
8299,"During this week and the next, the normal work of the office, "
8300,such as interviewing witnesses in the office or in the grand jury and 
8301,"requesting the FBI to interview witnesses or obtain documents, was "
8302,"not directly supervised by Petersen, but he was kept informed about "
8303,9 The Committee earlier had subpoenaed Presidential tapes for its hearings. 
8304,182
8305,major matters. He was briefed on and concurred with the position 
8306,WSPF was planning to take in further court proceedings over the 
8307,subpoenaed tapes and Bork approved that the proceedings be handled 
8308,by WSPF. On October 30 Ruth and Lacovara met with Judge Sirica 
8309,and White House Counsel Buzhardt to work out the procedures for 
8310,resolving claims of executive privilege which the President might 
8311,have with respect to particular passages in the tapes. During the 
8312,"meeting, Buzhardt informed Sirica that two of the subpoenaed "
8313,conversations had not been recorded. Sirica scheduled a public hear- 
8314,ing for the next day to examine the reasons for their nonexistence. 
8315,"On the evening of October 26, President Nixon announced in a "
8316,press conference that Acting Attorney General Bork would appoint 
8317,"a new Special Prosecutor for the Watergate matter, said that he "
8318,would not provide any new tapes and documents involving Presi- 
8319,"dential conversations to the new prosecutor, and indicated that the "
8320,prosecutor would not be allowed to seek such material through the 
8321,"courts. Softening that position, Haig said on a television program "
8322,on October 28 that the new Special Prosecutor would not have to 
8323,pledge not to seek White House tapes and documents. 
8324,Over the weekend Bork began calling possible candidates. On 
8325,"October 30, Haig called Leon Jaworski of Houston, Texas, who had "
8326,"served as president of the American Bar Association, and asked him "
8327,to accept the position; Jaworski agreed to come to Washington the 
8328,next day to discuss it. Jaworski said he would take the job only if he 
8329,would be free to bring judicial proceedings if necessary to obtain 
8330,tapes and other materials he needed. At their meeting Haig left the 
8331,room and a short time later returned and told Jaworski that the 
8332,President had agreed that Jaworski would have the right to seek any 
8333,materials he felt were necessary to carry out his duties and could go 
8334,"to court against the President, if necessary, to obtain such materials. "
8335,"This assurance was then repeated to Bork, White House Counsel "
8336,"Garment and Buzhardt, Petersen, and Senator William Saxbe, whom "
8337,the President had chosen to be the new Attorney General. Jaworski 
8338,accepted the job on the basis of these assurances. No change in the 
8339,jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor was discussed. 
8340,"On November 1, President Nixon announced the nomination of "
8341,William Saxbe to be Attorney General. Bork then announced the 
8342,appointment of Jaworski. He said that Jaworski would have the same 
8343,charter as Cox had had and said that the President had given his per- 
8344,sonal assurance that he would not exercise his right to fire the Special 
8345,Prosecutor without first obtaining the consensus of the majority and 
8346,minority leaders of the House and Senate and the chairmen and rank- 
8347,ing members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. An order 
8348,in accordance with this assurance was issued by Bork the next day. 
8349,183
8350,Jaworski was sworn in as Special Prosecutor on November 5. 
8351,"That afternoon he addressed the entire staff of WSPF, then met with "
8352,"the senior staff, and then with Cox, Ruth and Lacovara. He began his "
8353,duties promptly by meeting the next day with each of the task forced 
8354,to review their investigations. 
8355,REACTION TO C0X 7 S FIRING AND LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS 
8356,TO ESTABLISH A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR 
8357,Cox’s press conference on October 20 had been televised nationally. 
8358,"Following it, and greatly increasing after the resignation of Richardson "
8359,"and the firing of Cox and Ruckelshaus were announced, the public "
8360,overwhelmingly expressed support for Cox and dismay at President 
8361,Nixon’s actions. 10 Many insisted that the President comply with the 
8362,"court orders, resign, or be impeached. On October 22, NRC News "
8363,reported that a scientific sampling poll conducted since the night of 
8364,"October 20 showed 44 percent of Americans favored impeaching Nixon, "
8365,"75 percent opposed the dismissal of Cox, 48 percent thought Nixon "
8366,"should resign, and 54 percent thought Watergate should not be “put "
8367,behind us.” 
8368,"Labor leaders, lawyers, newspapers, and others called for the "
8369,President’s resignation or impeachment. Ralph Nader announced 
8370,that he would file a lawsuit challenging the firing of Cox. The president 
8371,"of the American Bar Association, Chesterfield Smith, called on the "
8372,"courts and the Congress to take appropriate action, including but not "
8373,limited to creation of a new Special Prosecutor independent of the 
8374,executive branch. Various protest marches and rallies were held. 
8375,"Hearing of the resignation and firings, the Senators who had been "
8376,drawn into the tapes issue also were dismayed. Senator Baker said 
8377,he was shocked and said he had not known in advance that President 
8378,Nixon was planning to forbid Cox to pursue his court quest. Senator 
8379,Ervin said he did not see where his and Baker’s tentative agreement 
8380,with the President to accept verified transcripts of taped conver- 
8381,sations would have any relation whatever to Cox or his work. Senator 
8382,"Stennis, the proposed verifier, said that he had not been told that "
8383,Cox had rejected the President’s proposal. 
8384,On October 22 the Associated Press polled 75 House members 
8385,and found 44 for impeachment and 17 undecided. The few House 
8386,Democratic leaders who were in AVashington over the holiday weekend 
8387,met and tentatively agreed that the House Judiciary Committee 
8388,"10 The public reaction was reflected in telephone calls, telegrams, and letters "
8389,"to the White House, the Congress, and other Government agencies. On October 23 "
8390,Western Union announced that its Washington office had been inundated and 
8391,that three high-speed teleprinters had been installed in Virginia to handle the 
8392,"baoklog. Over 160,000 telegrams had been received. By October 29, over 350,000 "
8393,telegrams had been sent to Washington on this issue in the preceding nine days. 
8394,184
8395,should make a preliminary investigation to determine whether there 
8396,were grounds to impeach President Nixon. They also discussed whether 
8397,"Congress could, constitutionally, create a special prosecutor post in "
8398,the executive branch completely independent of presidential control. 
8399,They scheduled a meeting with the full leadership for the next day 
8400,to discuss these issues further. The Senate Judiciary Committee 
8401,scheduled a meeting for October 24 to decide whether to conduct a 
8402,hearing on the resignation and firings. 
8403,"On the morning of October 23, House Republican leaders met "
8404,with Presidential Advisor Bryce Harlow and told him that they 
8405,would not try to block impeachment proceedings unless the President 
8406,made the Watergate tapes available to the District Court. They 
8407,also urged appointment of a new Special Prosecutor. When the House 
8408,"convened at noon that day, Gerald Ford announced, on behalf of the "
8409,"Republican leaders, that they had no objection to the Democratic "
8410,plan to refer impeachment resolutions to the House Judiciary Com- 
8411,mittee. Already that morning seven such resolutions had been so 
8412,referred. 
8413,That same morning Elliot Richardson held a nationally televised 
8414,press conference at the Department of Justice. While refusing to charge 
8415,President Nixon with failure to respect the claims of the investigative 
8416,"process, Richardson declared that in going to the Department of "
8417,Justice his single most important commitment to helping restore the 
8418,integrity of the governmental processes was his pledge to the in- 
8419,dependence of the Special Prosecutor and that he could not be faithful 
8420,to that commitment and also acquiesce in the curtailment of the 
8421,Special Prosecutor’s authority. He said that in Cox’s shoes he would 
8422,"have done what Cox had done, and he said he thought a new Special "
8423,Prosecutor should be appointed. 
8424,After the 2 p.m. announcement that the President would turn the 
8425,"subpoenaed tapes over to Judge Sirica, Haig and Wright held a press "
8426,conference at the W 7 hite House to explain the reversal. Haig gave the 
8427,President’s reasons for having sought the compromise: polarization 
8428,"within the body politic, with the threat of impeachment and the "
8429,possibility that the President might be removed with no Vice Presi- 
8430,dent in office; the intensification and prolongation of debate if the 
8431,President appealed the case to the Supreme Court; and suspicion of 
8432,"disunity by any foreign leader calculating the unity, permanence, "
8433,"strength, and resilience of this Government. Calling President Nixon’s "
8434,proposal that Stennis listen to and report on the tapes “a herculean 
8435,effort to resolve the constitutional crisis” and “a fundamental con- 
8436,"cession in the national interest,” Haig said that when Cox defied the "
8437,President by challenging the proposal the President had no alterna- 
8438,tive but to dismiss him. 
8439,Denying that President Nixon had decided before the previous 
8440,week to dismiss Cox because his office was making its investigations 
8441,185
8442,"broader than the President considered proper, Haig said that “many "
8443,"of us” were concerned about the political alignment of Cox’s staff, "
8444,"that it was roaming outside its charter, and there had been occasions, "
8445,"before the dispute of the previous week, when the President was not "
8446,pleased with Cox’s conduct. 11 Haig indicated that the President would 
8447,adhere to his plan to put the Watergate case within the institutional 
8448,framework of the Department of Justice. 
8449,This plan was strongly opposed by many members of Congress. On 
8450,"October 23, establishment of an independent special prosecutor was "
8451,"proposed in two House bills, one calling for appointment of the prose- "
8452,"cutor by majority vote of the House and Senate, the other calling for "
8453,appointment by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals. In the 
8454,Senate two bills calling for appointment of a special prosecutor by 
8455,the Chief Judge of the District Court were introduced and referred 
8456,to the Judiciary Committee. 
8457,Throughout the week House Republican leaders met with Bryce 
8458,Harlow and White House lawyers to implore them to persuade Presi- 
8459,dent Nixon to name a new special prosecutor in order to forestall the 
8460,legislation. Senate Republican leaders urged the same and agreed that 
8461,if the President declined they would support (or not oppose) legislation 
8462,under which the District Court would do so. 
8463,The President’s announcement on October 26 that he would have 
8464,Bork appoint a new special prosecutor did not relieve Congressional 
8465,pressure for a statutorily created prosecutor. Both the House and 
8466,the Senate Judiciary Committees began consideration of such legis- 
8467,lation the following week. Cox appeared before the Senate Committee 
8468,"on October 29, 30 and 31 to describe his former staff, his jurisdiction, "
8469,"his progress, and his unsuccessful efforts to obtain documents from "
8470,the White House. He urged legislation to create an Office of Special 
8471,"Prosecutor with District Court appointment of the prosecutor, juris- "
8472,"diction at least as broad as he had had, and specified standing to "
8473,invoke judicial process to obtain evidence. The House Judiciary’s 
8474,Subcommittee on Criminal Justice began its hearings on October 31 
8475,"and heard legislators, lawyers, and law professors support various "
8476,legislative proposals. 
8477,Notwithstanding the announcement on November 1 of Jaworski’s 
8478,"appointment, both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House "
8479,Judicial Subcommittee on Criminal Justice continued their hearings 
8480,on the special prosecutor legislation. 
8481,Bork testified before the House Subcommittee on November 5 
8482,that any such legislation could be unconstitutional and indicated 
8483,"11 In his October 20, 1973, press conference, in referring to his telephone call "
8484,"from Wright on the evening of October 18, Cox said: “It was my impression "
8485,that I was being confronted with things which were drawn in such a way that I 
8486,could not accept them.” 
8487,186
8488,that he might advise the President to veto it. He pointed out that 
8489,defendants could go free if the legislation were found unconstitutional 
8490,and that witnesses and evidence could be lost in the delays for testing 
8491,the law’s constitutionality. He emphasized the Special Prosecutor’s 
8492,independence as assured by Haig and by the Congressional “con- 
8493,sensus” clause in the new Special Prosecutor charter. Bork was fol- 
8494,lowed by Cox who told the Subcommittee that he felt the overriding 
8495,"concern was continuing the Watergate investigations. Thus, prompt "
8496,action on either a statute for District Court appointment of a new 
8497,special prosecutor or one for Presidential appointment with approval 
8498,of the Senate was more important than which of the two methods was 
8499,chosen. 
8500,Richardson testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on 
8501,November 6 and 8. He reiterated the practical reasons he had given 
8502,in his nomination testimony for establishment of a special prosecutor 
8503,only within the executive branch and suggested appointment of a 
8504,new prosecutor by President Nixon with confirmation by the Senate. 
8505,He also called for a commitment by the President to waive executive 
8506,privilege with respect to any Presidential materials the Special 
8507,Prosecutor needed and suggested that the Senate might hold up their 
8508,confirmation of Saxbe as Attorney General until the President made 
8509,such a commitment. 
8510,"On November 8, Jaworski testified before the House Subcommittee "
8511,that passage and legal testing of a statute providing for appointment 
8512,of a Special Prosecutor outside the executive branch would delay 
8513,the effective work of his office for an extended period of time and 
8514,that he had what he considered all of the independence that could 
8515,be expected by a Special Prosecutor. He stressed the unqualified 
8516,"assurances he had received from Haig, after Haig had consulted with "
8517,"the President, that there would be absolutely no constraints on his "
8518,freedom to seek any and all evidence and to invoke judicial process 
8519,should he consider it necessary. 
8520,"The Subcommittee then drafted, and on November 12 referred "
8521,"to the full Judiciary Committee, a bill under which a Special Prose- "
8522,cutor would be appointed by a panel of three judges of the District 
8523,"Court, and removed only by that panel and only for gross dereliction "
8524,"of duty, gross impropriety, or physical or mental inability to discharge "
8525,his powers and duties. The Special Prosecutor would have all of the 
8526,jurisdictional and functional authority that the previous Special 
8527,"Prosecutors had had, would report annually to the panel, the Attorney "
8528,"General, and the Congress, and would serve for a term of three years. "
8529,On November 14 Bork testified before the Senate Judiciary Com- 
8530,"mittee, reiterating the practical problems and constitutional questions "
8531,that he had voiced before the House Subcommittee as to the special 
8532,prosecutor legislation. He emphasized the important safeguard that 
8533,the Congressional consensus clause added to the Special Prosecutor’s 
8534,"independence and explained that, although he had not spoken to the "
8535,"President personally about it, he considered the President's knowledge "
8536,that he was going to include the clause to be the President's personal 
8537,assurance and a moral commitment by the President to the Congress 
8538,"and the American people. Bork explained that, in addition to dismissal, "
8539,the consensus requirement related to any attempt to limit the Special 
8540,Prosecutor's power . 12 
8541,The final witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee was 
8542,"Jaworski, who testified on November 20. He emphasized the strength "
8543,of the assurances he had received both from Haig and from the charter 
8544,re-establishing the Prosecution Force. Jaworski explained that he 
8545,thought his charter included all of the matters he thought he should 
8546,have under his jurisdiction and that if he came upon some matter 
8547,which he thought he should investigate which was not included he 
8548,would ask the Attorney General for its inclusion. He pointed out that 
8549,Bork had told him he was to be completely independent from any 
8550,obligation to report to or to seek the advice or counsel of the Attorney 
8551,General. 
8552,The House Judiciary Committee reported its Subcommittee's 
8553,"Special Prosecutor bill to the full House on November 26, with an "
8554,additional provision that the Special Prosecutor report at least 
8555,"monthly, to the chairman and ranking minority member of the Com- "
8556,"mittee, any information pertinent to whether impeachable offenses "
8557,had been committed b}^ Richard Nixon. The Senate Judiciary Com- 
8558,"mittee, divided equally, reported two bills to the full Senate on Dec- "
8559,"ember 3, one similar to the House bill and the other providing for "
8560,appointment of a Special Prosecutor by the Attorney General after 
8561,consultation with Senate leaders and prohibiting removal of the 
8562,Prosecutor without the consensus of certain congressional leaders. 
8563,None of the bills was enacted into law. 
8564,A further opportunity for the Senate to consider the independence 
8565,and authority granted to the Special Prosecutor under the charter 
8566,prepared by Bork was afforded to the Senate Judiciary Committee 
8567,in the November 1973 hearings on the nomination of Saxbe to be 
8568,Attorney General. Saxbe pledged that Jaworski would operate com- 
8569,"pletely freely and Saxbe would see him only at Jaworski's request, "
8570,that he would give Jaworski any reasonable assistance he could 
8571,"furnish from the Justice Department, and that he would inform the "
8572,Committee of any White House attempt to limit the jurisdiction or to 
8573,12 This aspect was not clear in the charter. On November 19 Bork issued an 
8574,amendment specifying that the jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor would not 
8575,be limited without the consensus of the designated members of Congress. This 
8576,order and a clarifying letter from Bork are included in Appendix J. For a fuller 
8577,"explanation of the assurance, see Borins testimony before the Senate Judiciary "
8578,"Committee on December 13, 1973 (93d Congress, 1st Session, Hearings on the "
8579,"Nomination of William Saxbe to be Attorney General, pp. 85-88). "
8580,188
8581,tamper with the charter of the Special Prosecutor. Jaworski promised 
8582,to bring any impasse to the attention of the Congressional “Committee 
8583,of Eight” designated in his charter and the Judiciary Committees of 
8584,the House and Senate. 
8585,CIVIL SUIT AGAINST COX'S DISMISSAL 
8586,On October 23 Ralph Nader and other co-plaintiffs filed a civil 
8587,suit against the firing of Archibald Cox with Acting Attorney General 
8588,Bork named as defendant. On October 29 Nader filed a motion to have 
8589,Cox reinstated as the Special Prosecutor and to have the Watergate 
8590,"investigations halted until Cox reassumed control. On November 9, "
8591,"Judge Gesell dismissed Nader as a plaintiff, stating that Nader clearly "
8592,"lacked the legal standing to bring such a suit, declined to order Cox "
8593,"reinstated, noting that Cox had not entered the case or otherwise "
8594,"sought reinstatement, and declined to halt the investigations, noting "
8595,that a new Special Prosecutor had been sworn in and that the public 
8596,interest would not be served by placing restrictions on his investigations. 
8597,"On November 14 Gesell found that the firing of Cox, in the absence "
8598,of a finding of extraordinary impropriety as specified in the regulation 
8599,"establishing the Office of Watergate Special Prosecutor, was illegal, "
8600,that that regulation barred the total abolition of the Special Prosecu- 
8601,"tor’s office without the Special Prosecutor’s consent, and that even if "
8602,"the regulation did not bar total abolition without that consent, its "
8603,revocation under the circumstances presented in this case was arbi- 
8604,trary and unreasonable and was therefore illegal. Gesell called the 
8605,abolition and reinstatement of the office under a virtually identical 
8606,regulation “simply a ruse to permit the discharge of Mr. Cox without 
8607,otherwise affecting the office of the Special Prosecutor.” As to the 
8608,"legality of Leon Jaworski’s service, Gesell held that Bork’s actions "
8609,in appointing a new Special Prosecutor were not themselves illegal 
8610,since Cox’s decision not to seek reinstatement necessitated the prompt 
8611,appointment of a successor to carry on the important work in which 
8612,Cox had been engaged.

8615,Appendix C: 
8616,Relations With the Office of the United States 
8617,Attorney for the District of Columbia 
8618,The original Watergate investigation was conducted under the 
8619,"general supervision of the Justice Department and Harold Titus, "
8620,U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The Assistant U.S. 
8621,Attorneys who handled the investigation on a day-to-day basis were 
8622,"Earl Silbert (Principal Assistant U.S. Attorney), Seymour Glanzer "
8623,"(head of the U.S. Attorney’s Fraud Section), and Donald Campbell. "
8624,"Their investigation resulted in the indictment on September 15, 1972, "
8625,of seven men in connection with the burglary and bugging of the 
8626,Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate. By 
8627,"late January 1973, the seven defendants had been found guilty — "
8628,five after pleas of guilty and two following a jury trial. All except 
8629,McCord were sentenced to provisional prison terms on March 23. 
8630,"After these convictions, the Assistant U.S. Attorneys continued "
8631,"their investigation during the spring of 1973, spurred on by charges "
8632,by one of the convicted men that there had been a widepsread cover- 
8633,"up, involving senior White House officials among others, to conceal "
8634,the involvement of CRP officials in the planning of the break-in. 
8635,"These charges, together with continuing revelations by the Wash- "
8636,ington Post and other newspapers and the April 30 departure from the 
8637,"Nixon Administration of Ehrlichman, Haldeman, Kleindienst, and "
8638,"Dean, created mounting pressure for the appointment of an independ- "
8639,ent prosecutor to take over the Watergate investigations. 1 
8640,"On May 25, Attorney General Elliot Richardson appointed "
8641,Archibald Cox as Special Prosecutor to investigate “Watergate” 
8642,matters. Cox was given assurances of complete independence and 
8643,"within a week, Richardson issued a directive to all Justice Department "
8644,personnel: 
8645,"Effective immediately, all Divisions, Offices, Services, and "
8646,"Bureaus of the Department, including the Federal Bureau of "
8647,"Investigation and all United States Attorneys, will report to and "
8648,cooperate with the Special Prosecutor on all matters within his 
8649,jurisdiction. 
8650,While those who had been in charge of the original investigation 
8651,were notified in the directive that “work on pending investigations or 
8652,1 The Senate had already appointed a Select Committee to conduct its own 
8653,investigation of the Watergate scandals. 
8654,190
8655,"prosecutions shall continue for the present without interruption,” all "
8656,those previously engaged in conducting the investigations were 
8657,directed “to make prompt written reports to the Special Prosecutor 
8658,of all allegations and pending investigations or prosecutions falling 
8659,within the jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor.” 
8660,Their replacement by a Special Prosecutor could not help but 
8661,"rankle the U.S. Attorney and his staff, as it seemed to cast doubts on "
8662,their integrity and to suggest that their investigation had been less 
8663,"than thorough. 2 Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen, head of "
8664,"the Justice Department's Criminal Division, commented forcefully on "
8665,this point during his testimony before the Senate Select Committee a 
8666,few months later: 
8667,"I resent the appointment of a Special Prosecutor. Damn it, "
8668,1 think it is a reflection on me and the Department of Justice. We 
8669,could have broken that case wide open and we would have done it 
8670,in the most difficult circumstances. And do you know what hap- 
8671,pened. That case was snatched out from under us when we had it 
8672,90-percent completed with a recognition of the Senate of the United 
8673,"States that we can't trust those guys down there, and we would "
8674,"have made that case and maybe you would have made it different, "
8675,but I would have made it my way and Silbert would have made it 
8676,his way and we would have convicted those people and immunized 
8677,them and we would have gotten a breakthrough. I am not minimiz- 
8678,"ing what you have done or the press or anyone else, but the De- "
8679,partment of Justice had that case going and it was snatched away 
8680,"from us, and I don't think it fair to criticize us because at that "
8681,point we didn’t have the evidence to go forward. 3 * 
8682,2 The Special Prosecutor was alert to the possibility that his predecessors 
8683,might be viewed as scapegoats. In a later letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee 
8684,which was considering the nomination of Silbert to be U.S. Attorney for the 
8685,"District of Columbia, he expressed the view that Silbert and his colleagues had "
8686,acted with fairness and professionalism during their handling of the investigation. 
8687,3 Hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign 
8688,"Activities, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., Book 9, Testimony of Henry E. Petersen, Assistant "
8689,"Attorney General, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Aug. 7, 1973, p. "
8690,3639
8691,The Special Prosecutor’s staff found that far from being “90-percent com- 
8692,"pleted, 5 ’ 9 months of additional work was needed before indictments in the Water- "
8693,"gate cover-up case. When WSPF was formed, only 2 months had elapsed since "
8694,James McCord’s letter to Judge Sirica and the complex nature of the case re- 
8695,"quired much more investigative work by the prosecutors. In fairness to Petersen, "
8696,it should be noted that much time was spent in obtaining and analyzing White 
8697,"House documents and tapes, evidence which had been unavailable to the original "
8698,prosecutors. 
8699,The decision of the Senate to conduct its own investigation also angered the 
8700,"U.S. Attorneys. On May 15, U.S. Attorney Titus wrote to Attorney General- "
8701,"designate Richardson, complaining that the timing of the Committee’s pending "
8702,hearings confronted the U.S. Attorney’s office with the possible “insuperable” 
8703,obstacle of prejudicial pretrial publicity. Although expressing sympathy for the 
8704,"prosecutors’ concerns, Richardson explained that there was little he could do "
8705,until his appointment was confirmed other than to discuss the problem at the 
8706,earliest possible opportunity with the Chairman of the Committee and the yet-to- 
8707,be appointed Special Prosecutor. 
8708,191
8709,Cox’s first act following his appointment as Special Prosecutor on 
8710,"May 25 was to seek the continued assistance of Silbert, Glanzer and "
8711,"Campbell on the Watergate case, although he had reached no decision "
8712,regarding their permanent status with the Special Prosecutor’s office. 
8713,Cox’s primary interests at the time were to preserve the integrity 
8714,"and continuity of the investigation, familiarize himself with the work "
8715,"already performed, and establish his own authority to make decisions "
8716,concerning the matters under his jurisdiction. 
8717,"On May 24, even before assuming office, Cox had made these "
8718,"points clear in a letter to U.S. Attorney Titus. Among other things, "
8719,Cox urged that there be no break or delay in the investigation. 
8720,He wrote : 
8721,The public interest requires you as honorable and responsible 
8722,public officials to carry on while I am familiarizing myself with all 
8723,that has been done; and at that time we can see what is most ap- 
8724,propriate for the future. As soon as I have taken office in the 
8725,"Department, I would of course expect to be consulted before any "
8726,decisions were made. 
8727,"In an early meeting with Titus, Cox went over many of the points "
8728,"covered in his May 24 letter, emphasizing the need to refrain from any "
8729,"public comment on the investigation or, if any public comment were "
8730,"appropriate, that it come from the Special Prosecutor himself. 4 What "
8731,particularly concerned Cox at this juncture were press reports specu- 
8732,lating on possible prosecutorial theories regarding the Watergate 
8733,cover-up. Cox emphasized to Titus that all decisions about case 
8734,"theories, decisions to prosecute or acceptance of guilty pleas “will be "
8735,"made by me,” and instructed Titus and his staff to “refrain from any "
8736,kind of statement or comment about any aspect” of the case. 
8737,"On May 25, however, the Washington Post reported an announce- "
8738,ment by Titus that the Watergate prosecutors had reached a break- 
8739,"through, that “an unidentified member of the criminal conspiracy "
8740,to cover up the Watergate affair will plead guilty and testify against 
8741,"others involved,” and predicted that there would be “comprehensive "
8742,indictments within 60-90 days.” Titus was also quoted as having said 
8743,that his assistants had developed “and outlined before the grand jury 
8744,a comprehensive and coherent theory of prosecution.” The article 
8745,went on to quote “sources” familiar with the investigation who de- 
8746,fended the work of the original Watergate prosecutors and pointed 
8747,out that “the withdrawal of the three prosecutors from the case after 
8748,11 months of investigation would seriously delay indictments.” 
8749,"Finally, the article stated that most of the work on the cover-up case "
8750,4 Cox’s handwritten notes taken during the meeting show this concern: 
8751,“Press stories (a) damaging to professionalism and fairness of investigation — 
8752,prejudice fair trial — prejudice me. (b) pledge of the tightest security; no discus- 
8753,sions of any kind whatsoever with any member of the press: no state’s ‘state- 
8754,ments’.” 
8755,192
8756,"was complete, and U.S. Attorney Titus hinted that negotiations were "
8757,underway “toward getting others involved in the Watergate cover-up 
8758,to plead guilty.” 
8759,These statements and unattributed comments in support of the 
8760,"original prosecutors, coming at the outset of Cox’s own investigation, "
8761,suggested an attempt to force Cox to retain the original prosecutors 
8762,and to acknowledge their theory of the case. These statements may 
8763,also have been the basis for Petersen’s later claim that the investiga- 
8764,tion was “90-percent completed” when Cox took over. 
8765,"Also, on May 25, the day Cox became Special Prosecutor, he met "
8766,with Silbert to emphasize that “no significant action of any kind should 
8767,be taken without alerting me and giving me a chance to exercise my 
8768,"judgment. Specifially, there should be no further press releases about "
8769,"any aspect of these cases.” 5 Four days later, on May 29, Silbert sent "
8770,Cox a memorandum suggesting areas in which the Special Prosecutor 
8771,could be of significant aid to the U.S. Attorneys in the conduct of the 
8772,Watergate investigation: these included assistance with problems 
8773,arising out of the upcoming Senate hearings; the need to secure 
8774,documents from the White House; and the task of digesting grand 
8775,"jury testimony. Shortly thereafter, Cox assigned two members of "
8776,his fledgling staff to work with the U.S. Attorneys on these and 
8777,other problems. 
8778,"On June 7, Silbert and his team wrote a status memorandum to "
8779,Cox. The 87-page document summarized the evidence to date both in 
8780,the cover-up matter and in the investigation of the Plumbers’ break-in 
8781,at the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist in California. The 
8782,summary also included a status report as to many possibly involved 
8783,individuals and reported on informal and formal immunities that had 
8784,"been granted some witnesses. At the same time, Silbert and Cox "
8785,had a disagreement over whether or not the original prosecutors 
8786,could send investigative requests directly to the FBI. Cox cancelled 
8787,"such a request from Silbert to the Bureau and directed that Silbert, "
8788,Glanzer and Campbell move to the Special Prosecutor’s offices with 
8789,"their files. In a letter to Titus, Cox explained his order on the basis of "
8790,a “firm conviction that such a move is essential if their work with 
8791,members of my staff is to go forward conveniently and effectively.” 
8792,"Throughout the remaining part of June, Cox’s staff became familiar "
8793,"with the cover-up investigation, and inevitably the nature of the "
8794,Special Prosecutor’s charter required that Cox’s own team take over 
8795,"the matter. On June 29, 1973, in a five-page letter to Cox, the three "
8796,original prosecutors asked to be relieved of Watergate-related re- 
8797,sponsibilities and to return to the U.S. Attorney’s office. 
8798,"5 Memo from Cox to Titus dated May 25, 1973, relaying Cox’s comments to "
8799,Silbert that morning and requesting Titus to follow the same instructions. 
8800,193
8801,"In reply, Cox spoke kindly of the three men : "
8802,You acted in a highly creditable fashion in acceding to my 
8803,request that you put the interests of the Watergate investigation 
8804,ahead of your own wishes and give us the benefit of your know- 
8805,ledge and experience during a period of transition. 
8806,Perhaps I may add in closing that I realize this has not been an 
8807,easy time for you. I am aware of various criticisms of your earlier 
8808,conduct of the investigation and prosecution of seven defendants. 
8809,"Lawyers often differ on questions of judgment, and there are "
8810,points on which my judgment might have varied from yours. 
8811,"Thus far in the investigation, however, none of us has seen any- "
8812,thing to show that you did not pursue your professional duties 
8813,according to your honest judgment and in complete good faith. 
8814,"By July 1, a month after Cox had commenced his assignment, the "
8815,Watergate investigation was entirely in the hands of the new Special 
8816,Prosecutor. 
8817,"In the ensuing 2 years, Silbert and his staff frequently made them- "
8818,selves available for consultation regarding various aspects of their 
8819,earlier Watergate inquiry and other investigations; there were a 
8820,number of referrals of investigative matters between the two offices; 
8821,and the U.S. Attorney's office provided assistance to the Special Pros- 
8822,ecutor's office when new grand juries were empanelled and when it 
8823,became necessary for WSPF to obtain office space and support 
8824,"facilities in the courthouse during the trials it conducted. Thus, "
8825,although the U.S. Attorney's office assumed a minor role in the Water- 
8826,"gate investigation after the early summer of 1973, it provided valuable "
8827,assistance during the remainder of WSPF's tenure.

8829,Appendix D: 
8830,Relations With 
8831,the Attorney General 
8832,INTRODUCTION 
8833,Under the regulations establishing the Office of the Watergate 
8834,"Special Prosecution Force, 1 the Director of the Office is the Special "
8835,Prosecutor appointed by the Attorney General. The regulations 
8836,"provide, in effect, that the Special Prosecutor is to exercise the powers "
8837,of the Attorney General in all matters under his jurisdiction and is 
8838,to operate without direction from the Attorney General. The regula- 
8839,tions also provide that there may be such consultation between the 
8840,Special Prosecutor and the Attorney General as the Special Prosecutor 
8841,deems appropriate. 2 
8842,"There has been, however, no impenetrable insulation between "
8843,the Attorneys General and the three Special Prosecutors who have 
8844,served since May 1973. This was particularly true during the months 
8845,immediately following the establishment of the office when there 
8846,were a number of contacts between Special Prosecutor Cox and At- 
8847,torney General Richardson and their respective staffs. These contacts 
8848,were part of a continuing process of clarifying questions about the 
8849,"scope of the Prosecutor’s jurisdiction, discussing Government policy on "
8850,"especially sensitive matters, arranging for the exercise of powers "
8851,"which only the Attorney General could exercise, and developing "
8852,mechanisms for accommodation and cooperation in areas of overlapping 
8853,interest between the Special Prosecutor and the regular operating 
8854,divisions of the Department of Justice. 
8855,THE SCOPE OF THE 
8856,SPECIAL PROSECUTOR'S CHARTER 
8857,The early contacts between Richardson and Cox after Cox’s 
8858,appointment focused upon questions about the proper line of demarca- 
8859,1 28 C.F.R. § 0.37 et seq . 
8860,"2 See generally United States v. Nixon , 418 U.S. 683 (1974). "
8861,195
8862,tion between the jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor’s office and 
8863,that of the Criminal Division. Although it was clear that the Special 
8864,Prosecutor superseded the United States Attorney and the Assistant 
8865,Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division in such matters 
8866,"as the Watergate cover-up investigation, transitional problems re- "
8867,mained. One of the most important of these was the extent to which 
8868,cooperation and assistance would be available from the prosecutors 
8869,"previously involved in the investigation. 3 In addition, there were "
8870,possibilities that investigations by the Special Prosecutor’s office 
8871,into illegal corporate political activity might overlap with similar 
8872,investigations normally under the jurisdiction of the Elections Unit 
8873,in the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division. The resolution of 
8874,this problem involved assertion of primary jurisdiction by the Special 
8875,"Prosecutor, with the Fraud Section continuing with a number of "
8876,General Accounting Office referrals where investigation was well 
8877,"underway. As to these, the Special Prosecutor retained supervisory "
8878,authority. 
8879,The first sharply-defined question about the Special Prosecutor’s 
8880,"jurisdiction arose on July 3, 1973, when an article in the Los Angeles "
8881,Times claimed that the Special Prosecutor had begun a preliminary 
8882,investigation into the expenditures of public funds for President 
8883,"Nixon’s home in San Clemente, California. Attorney General Richard- "
8884,"son, responding to an inquiry from the White House, contacted the "
8885,Special Prosecutor to express his doubt that such an investigation fell 
8886,within the Special Prosecutor's jurisdiction. Special Prosecutor Cox 
8887,explained that the story was inaccurate because in fact there was no 
8888,"such investigation under way, but he objected to an interpretation of "
8889,his charter that excluded from his jurisdiction one kind of allegation 
8890,involving the President. It was agreed that the Special Prosecutor 
8891,would issue a public announcement stating that the Times story was 
8892,unfounded. 
8893,"A week later, the Attorney General and the Special Prosecutor "
8894,met to discuss whether the Justice Department should screen factual 
8895,allegations to ascertain whether they were substantial enough to war- 
8896,rant referral to the Special Prosecutor’s Office. The Special Prose- 
8897,cutor objected to any procedure that would have the Criminal 
8898,Division do such a screening; instead it was agreed that all allegations 
8899,apparently falling within the jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor 
8900,would be referred immediately to him for his determination whether 
8901,"they fell within his sphere of responsibility and, even if so, whether "
8902,they should be remanded to the Criminal Division for investigation 
8903,and report. The latter category would include those allegations which 
8904,were insufficiently substantial to warrant the Special Prosecutor’s use 
8905,3 Appendix C details the WSPF relations with the U.S. Attorney’s office in 
8906,"Washington, D.C. "
8907,m 
8908,of the office’s limited resources or which related to investigations 
8909,pending in the Criminal Division. 
8910,It was also agreed that the Criminal Division and the Special 
8911,Prosecutor’s office would keep each other informed of significant de- 
8912,velopments in matters handled by either of them where the develop- 
8913,"ments might be of mutual interest, except where the Special Prosecutor "
8914,determined that such a disclosure on his part would be inconsistent 
8915,with his responsibilities. In a related matter the Special Prosecutor 
8916,"and the Attorney General agreed that, unless the Special Prosecutor "
8917,"determined in a specific case that it was not appropriate, he would "
8918,inform the Attorney General confidentially of allegations of impro- 
8919,priety by any current employee of the Department of Justice as soon 
8920,as such charges were brought to his attention. This arrangement 
8921,reflected the recognition that the Attorney General had a legitimate 
8922,interest in knowing promptly that a Justice Department official was 
8923,under suspicion. 
8924,Another point of discussion involving the scope of the Special 
8925,Prosecutor’s charter arose in late July 1973 as a result of a request from 
8926,the Special Prosecutor’s office for an opportunity to interview Secret 
8927,Service agents detailed to the White House. Attorney General 
8928,"Richardson stated that J. Fred Buzhardt, Special Counsel to the "
8929,"President, had objected to any inquiry by the Special Prosecutor’s "
8930,office into personnel assignments at the White House. Also raised at 
8931,that time was the White House objection to the Special Prosecutor’s 
8932,"request to interview Tom Charles Huston, the author of a secret 1970 "
8933,White House plan to improve coordination among the Federal do- 
8934,mestic intelligence agencies and to permit them to use illegal methods 
8935,in gathering information. The Attorney General stated that the White 
8936,House viewed this as part of an unauthorized and excessive in- 
8937,vestigation of all Federal intelligence activities during the Nixon 
8938,Administration. 
8939,"In response, the Special Prosecutor stated that there was no "
8940,"investigation of Secret Service personnel problems. However, if it "
8941,should appear that any improper activities were carried out by Secret 
8942,"Service personnel acting on White House detail, Cox took the position "
8943,that those activities fell within the branch of jurisdiction authorizing 
8944,the investigation of allegations of wrongdoing by White House per- 
8945,sonnel. 
8946,"With respect to Huston, the Special Prosecutor responded that "
8947,such an interview was considered part of an investigation falling 
8948,within the jurisdiction of the office. He informed Richardson that 
8949,there was no comprehensive investigation of all intelligence agencies 
8950,"but that, in connection with an investigation of particular surveillance "
8951,"practices, various Federal agencies had been asked to describe their "
8952,policies on electronic surveillance. 
8953,W7 
8954,With respect to charges that Cox was exceeding his jurisdiction 
8955,"generally, WSPF told Richardson that he could assure the White "
8956,House that the Special Prosecutor had sufficient matters clearly within 
8957,his jurisdiction so that it was not necessary to force his way into mat- 
8958,ters beyond his delegation. 
8959,Avowed concerns by the White House and the Attorney General 
8960,about “national security” surveillance policies continued to be a 
8961,subject of discussion between Richardson and Cox in early August. 
8962,Cox was interested in exploring certain surveillance policies of the 
8963,"Secret Service, but the Secret Service, on White House instructions, "
8964,had declined to respond to the inquiries. At the Attorney General's 
8965,suggestion the Special Prosecutor resolved the impasse by dealing 
8966,with the General Counsel of the Treasury Department. 
8967,"At a meeting on August 15, Richardson again raised the problems "
8968,that had been encountered because of the general breadth of the 
8969,Special Prosecutor's jurisdiction. He suggested that it might be de- 
8970,sirable to rewrite the original charter to be more specific and explained 
8971,that there were serious worries at the White House that the Special 
8972,Prosecutor was exceeding the boundaries originally contemplated for 
8973,the types of investigations that he would undertake. The original 
8974,guidelines specifying the jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor had 
8975,"been hurriedly prepared in May 1973, and the Special Prosecutor and "
8976,the Attorney General both understood that there were fringe areas in 
8977,the general grants of jurisdiction that might require some accommoda- 
8978,tion or interpretation in particular cases. Richardson expressed his 
8979,"understanding of the original mandate as including, for example, the "
8980,"activities of the White House “plumbers,” but as not extending more "
8981,broadly to other surreptitious surveillance activities that might have 
8982,"had some nexus with the White House, including the alleged wiretaps "
8983,on former White House and National Security Council staff members 
8984,and newspaper reporters. 
8985,Cox said that he regarded such an investigation as within the 
8986,natural scope of the language or spirit of his mandate. He expressed 
8987,"the view, however, that because of some arguable uncertainties re- "
8988,garding the lawfulness of electronic surveillance in “national security” 
8989,"cases, there might be grounds for declining to prosecute regular law "
8990,enforcement officers who had conducted surveillances formally ap- 
8991,proved by the Attorney General and bearing some palpable nexus to 
8992,legitimate defense secrets. He suggested that the relevant factors in 
8993,determining criminality would include (1) the regularized nature of 
8994,the procedures and personnel involved; (2) the occurrence or non- 
8995,occurrence of a physical trespass; and (3) the existence and basis of a 
8996,good-faith belief that national security was directly involved. The 
8997,parties agreed to think further about the jurisdictional issues and the 
8998,substantive elements not yet resolved. 
8999,19a 
9000,"At a later meeting in August, the Attorney General gave the Special "
9001,"Prosecutor a draft of guidelines which, through the use of a screening "
9002,"mechanism, would have narrowed the original basis for jurisdiction "
9003,over all White House staff members and Presidential appointees. The 
9004,draft also restricted Cox's authority to the “ ‘plumbers’ operations if 
9005,they constitute the commission of criminal offenses.” Richardson also 
9006,suggested the inclusion of the factors that the Special Prosecutor had 
9007,enumerated as the basis for judging possible criminality; and he also 
9008,"proposed that the new guidelines, as merely interpretive of Cox’s "
9009,"charter, need not be published. In addition, in order to alleviate the "
9010,concerns of the White House about possible unintended and unfore- 
9011,"seen damage to national security operations, he proposed that the "
9012,Special Prosecutor should consider accepting a special consultant on 
9013,"national security matters. The consultant, he suggested, could serve "
9014,as an intermediary between the Special Prosecutor’s office and the 
9015,intelligence agencies to advise the Special Prosecutor when he ap- 
9016,proached sensitive matters and to facilitate the acquisition of informa- 
9017,tion. The Attorney General suggested a specific former CIA official as 
9018,a candidate for such a position. 
9019,Cox objected to the limitations that Richardson proposed and 
9020,"insisted that they would have to be published, if ever issued, since "
9021,any such modifications in his charter would reflect a substantial 
9022,"alteration in the original, public mandate. He said also that, while "
9023,the idea of a particularly knowledgeable intelligence expert might 
9024,"have some value, he would consider the idea only if it was clear "
9025,that such a consultant was accountable solely to him and had no 
9026,authority to filter information before it came to him. 
9027,The Attorney General soon dropped both of these proposals and 
9028,the parties simply decided that they would notify each other of any 
9029,positions either the Special Prosecutor’s Office or the Department of 
9030,"Justice proposed to take on national security issues, and they would "
9031,attempt to resolve any conflicts at the staff level. 
9032,"In early September, the Attorney General and the Special Prose- "
9033,cutor reviewed the jurisdictional question once again. Cox stated that 
9034,upon review of pending investigations in his office he saw no problems 
9035,of questionable jurisdiction. He stated his additional belief that under 
9036,the charter there could be temporal boundaries on the matters that 
9037,"fell within his responsibility. Specifically, he did not regard his jurisdic- "
9038,tion as extending to matters occurring after his appointment in 1973 
9039,except to the extent that they interfered with or obstructed his 
9040,investigations or were part of a plan or course of conduct beginning 
9041,at an earlier time. This limitation was seen as clearly warranted 
9042,because an open-ended time frame for the charter would have given 
9043,the Special Prosecutor’s office the role of continuing to monitor 
9044,Government conduct for an indefinite period. That kind of breadth 
9045,199
9046,had not been the understanding of the limited purpose of selecting a 
9047,Special Prosecutor to deal with specific problems or types of problems 
9048,about which serious allegations had surfaced as of May 1973. 
9049,"In addition, Cox told Richardson that almost all the matters "
9050,"currently under investigation covered a time period after January 1, "
9051,"1971. They agreed that as a statement of attitude on Cox’s part, "
9052,this date could be regarded as a general backward limit of acts that 
9053,WSPF was investigating except as to any major allegations about 
9054,matters within the prime jurisdiction of the office and except as to 
9055,possible criminal acts involving general characteristics of wrongdoing 
9056,that were continued after January 1971. As to any borderline matters 
9057,"preceding January 1971, although they would fall within the broad "
9058,"general language of the WSPF charter, Cox said that he would secure a "
9059,specific delegation from the Attorney General so that no valid legal 
9060,"issues could be raised. It was also agreed that the Special Prosecutor, "
9061,"if so requested by the Attorney General, would consider assuming "
9062,jurisdiction over matters that would normally be beyond his authority. 
9063,"The Special Prosecutor insisted, however, that he could not agree "
9064,to any firm jurisdictional limitation on the kinds of cases ostensibly 
9065,covered by the terms of his original charter without violating assur- 
9066,ances he had given the Senate Judiciary Committee when he was 
9067,"initially appointed. For this reason, he explained that any efforts "
9068,to modify the substantive scope of his ji risdiction would have to be 
9069,raised with the Committee. 
9070,One specific area illustrates the way these arrangements were 
9071,"implemented. On September 21, Cox called Richardson to say that "
9072,his investigations of illegal political activities had uncovered two 
9073,situations occurring before January 1971 that were closely related to 
9074,the 1972 campaign investigations: one was the 1970 so-called “Town- 
9075,house Operation” run by the White House to raise and channel funds 
9076,"to Congressional candidates sympathetic to the President, and the "
9077,other was a 1968 contribution to the Presidential campaign of Senator 
9078,"Hubert Humphrey by Dwayne Andreas, whose activities were under "
9079,scrutiny because a 1972 campaign contribution by him eventually 
9080,had been deposited in the bank account of one of the Watergate 
9081,"burglars. As happened with all such requests from WSPF, the Attorney "
9082,General agreed that the Special Prosecutor should proceed with both 
9083,of those investigations. 
9084,EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE 
9085,Another source of contact between the Attorney General and 
9086,the Special Prosecutor involved the delicate and complex question 
9087,"of “executive privilege.” From the earliest days, Cox experienced "
9088,difficulties in obtaining documentary material or testimony from 
9089,the White House. To the extent that a justification was given for 
9090,m 
9091,"these refusals, the most frequent explanation was a claim of “executive "
9092,privilege.” Despite the irony of invoking such a privilege against 
9093,"an official of the Executive Branch, the White House adhered to "
9094,this claim through two rounds of unsuccessful litigation which cul- 
9095,"minated in the July 24, 1974, decision of a unanimous Supreme "
9096,Court directing President Nixon to turn over to the Special Prosecutor 
9097,several dozen subpoenaed White House tapes. 
9098,"During the earliest months of the Special Prosecutor’s office, the "
9099,issue of executive privilege was one of joint concern to Richardson 
9100,"and to Cox. On the one hand, Cox understood that he had an obliga- "
9101,tion to pursue evidence of crime which might be included in the papers 
9102,"of the President. On the other hand, he recognized that he was an "
9103,officer of the Department of Justice and that the Department of Jus- 
9104,tice had for many years been asserting and defending claims of execu- 
9105,tive privilege and was then involved in litigating such claims in the 
9106,"Federal courts. On a number of occasions, Richardson and Cox met "
9107,to discuss ways of accommodating their respective responsibilities 
9108,with the least damage to the positions and responsibilities of the other. 
9109,"As an outgrowth of these discussions, Cox determined that it "
9110,would be sufficient for his purposes to confine his arguments against 
9111,executive privilege to instances where evidence was needed for a 
9112,grand jury investigation or for a criminal trial. This allowed the 
9113,Department of Justice to continue taking its positions asserting exec- 
9114,utive privilege in civil litigation. This accommodation avoided any 
9115,"direct confrontation between the Special Prosecutor’s office, techni- "
9116,"cally a branch of the Justice Department, and the regular litigating "
9117,divisions of that Department. 
9118,One continuing source of tension on this subject was the Special 
9119,Prosecutor’s request for access to certain White House papers related 
9120,to the “milk fund” investigation. One of the investigations in the 
9121,Special Prosecutor’s office related to possible criminal activities in 
9122,connection with the Administration’s 1971 decision to increase the 
9123,"price support payments for milk. At the same time, there was pending "
9124,in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia a 
9125,"civil suit, Nader v. Butz , C.A. 418-72, which challenged the legality "
9126,of that increase. Among the plaintiff’s allegations were contentions 
9127,that the price support increase had been directed for political reasons 
9128,rather than for the reasons made relevant by the applicable statute. 
9129,"In connection with that litigation, the plaintiffs had subpoenaed "
9130,various White House documents and a claim of executive privilege 
9131,had been interposed. Although the documents were made available 
9132,to the Civil Division of the Department of Justice in asserting and 
9133,"defending the claim of executive privilege, the White House refused "
9134,to allow the Special Prosecutor’s office access to those same documents. 
9135,This distinction between the Civil Division and the Special Prose- 
9136,cutor’s office — both units of the Department of Justice — pursuant to 
9137,m 
9138,"which one was relied upon to assert executive privilege, while that "
9139,"same claim was invoked against the other, was an important example "
9140,of the White House policy of non-cooperation with the Special Prose- 
9141,cutor’s investigations. 
9142,Cox met several times on this point with Richardson who indicated 
9143,that he was attempting to convince the White House legal staff that 
9144,"their position was untenable. On several occasions, Cox was told that "
9145,the White House had not finally turned down his requests but that 
9146,"special reviews were being conducted. On August 13, Cox wrote to "
9147,Richardson formally requesting access to the “Milk Documents” 
9148,which the White House had given to the Civil Division for the Nader 
9149,v. Butz suit. He explained that these were important to the criminal 
9150,"investigation and that, under the standing arrangement, the Special "
9151,Prosecutor’s office would not object to the Justice Department claims 
9152,of executive privilege in civil matters but the Special Prosecutor would 
9153,challenge such claims in criminal proceedings. Two days later Richard- 
9154,son told Cox that Buzhardt had instructed him not to turn over the 
9155,milk papers and that Richardson had asked him to reconsider that 
9156,order. Richardson asked Cox to delay pressing the issue to give him a 
9157,"chance to obtain reversal of it. It was not until November 1973, after "
9158,"Cox had been fired, that these papers were actually made available. "
9159,NATIONAL SECURITY 
9160,The difficult concept of “national security” was the subject of 
9161,intermittent and inconclusive discussions between the various At- 
9162,torneys General and Special Prosecutors. Although later evidence 
9163,documented that much of the purported concern raised by the White 
9164,House about “national security” was part of a plan to use that vague 
9165,"concept to frustrate legitimate investigations, the various Attorneys "
9166,"General and Special Prosecutors recognized that, as responsible public "
9167,"officials, they could not ignore legitimate requirements, both legal and "
9168,"practical, that sensitive defense and intelligence information be pro- "
9169,tected. A number of these meetings involved discussions (referred to 
9170,above) distinguishing possible criminal activities conducted in the 
9171,name of national security from those that could not or should not be 
9172,prosecuted. There were also efforts to ascertain with some precision 
9173,what the Department of Justice had offically sanctioned and what it 
9174,had not purported to allow in the name of “national security.” These 
9175,discussions eventually spanned the tenures of all three Special Prosecu- 
9176,tors and never produced a comprehensive statement from the Depart- 
9177,ment as to all prior practices or as to the full scope of past or current 
9178,policies concerning “national security” operations. 
9179,"Finally, there were discussions about the difficulties that would "
9180,emerge in prosecutions where either the government or the defense 
9181,attorneys might need to present highly sensitive defense information in 
9182,m 
9183,public proceedings. It was understood from the outset that the Special 
9184,Prosecutor would attempt to frame the legal theories of prosecution 
9185,and the presentation of evidence in order to obviate the need for either 
9186,the Government or the defense to utilize any such information. At 
9187,various points both Special Prosecutors Cox and Jaworski were ad- 
9188,vised of such potential problems by either the Attorney General or 
9189,the White House. When classified information was needed for trial at 
9190,"later dates, WSPF adopted the usual Federal executive practice of "
9191,asking the classifying agency to declassify any document needed for 
9192,"trial. Although no insuperable problems ever, in fact, occurred, Cox "
9193,recognized in the early months of WSPF's existence that legitimate 
9194,national security concerns might force the voluntary dismissal of a 
9195,case if classified material necessary either to the prosecution or defense 
9196,"could not legitimately be declassified, or even made available to a "
9197,judge for decision about possible disclosure to the defense at trial. 
9198,ATTORNEY GENERAI/S POWERS 
9199,The final major subject of contacts between the Attorney General 
9200,and the Special Prosecutor involved matters where action by the 
9201,"Attorney General personally was necessary. For example, under the "
9202,"“use immunity” statute, 18 U.S.C. § 6001 et seq., applications for "
9203,court orders granting immunity in the face of a claim of the privilege 
9204,"against self-incrimination must be approved by the Attorney General, "
9205,"by his Deputy, or by a designated Assistant Attorney General. Al- "
9206,though the Special Prosecutor had been delegated powers comparable 
9207,"to those of the Attorney General and an Assistant Attorney General, "
9208,there was concern that the express reference in the statutes to specific 
9209,officials who are selected by the President and confirmed by the 
9210,Senate might not properly be extended to an official like the Special 
9211,Prosecutor who was appointed by the Attorney General. This problem 
9212,was specifically acute since the Justice Department at that time was 
9213,attempting to convince the Supreme Court in the case of United States 
9214,"v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505 (1974), that similar references in the Federal "
9215,wiretap statute should be read to allow other Justice Department 
9216,officials to exercise certain powers. (The Supreme Court subsequently 
9217,ruled unanimously that only the officials referred to in that statute 
9218,"could validly act.) For this reason, a procedure was established under "
9219,which the Special Prosecutor requested that the Attorney General 
9220,"approve applications for immunity, and the official certification of "
9221,approval was made by the Attorney General. No problems ever were 
9222,encountered in the implementation of this practice. 4 
9223,"4 In a related arrangement, the Special Prosecutor’s office and the Criminal "
9224,Division “Immunity Unit” regularly consulted about proposed immunity orders 
9225,to insure that neither the Justice Department’s operating divisions nor the Special 
9226,Prosecutor’s office unwittingly granted immunity to a person under active investi- 
9227,gation by the other. 
9228,203
9229,Access to tax returns also required involvement of the Attorney 
9230,General since under the Internal Revenue Code 5 and the imple- 
9231,"menting executive order, only the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney "
9232,"General, an Assistant Attorney General or a United States Attorney — "
9233,officials appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate — 
9234,could apply for access to tax returns as part of the investigative 
9235,"process. Early in the Special Prosecutor's term, he requested that the "
9236,Secretary of the Treasury arrange to amend the operative executive 
9237,order to authorize the Special Prosecutor to obtain access to tax 
9238,"returns directly. This request was held up for several months, and "
9239,on several occasions Richardson and Cox met to discuss how the 
9240,"Attorney General might resolve this issue, inasmuch as the White "
9241,House apparently would not process the amendment to the executive 
9242,order. No resolution was achieved prior to the resignation of Richard- 
9243,"son and the dismissal of Cox. After the dismissal, Special Prosecutor "
9244,Jaworski continued to pursue this issue and ultimately decided to 
9245,submit requests for tax information through the Attorney General 
9246,who forwarded them as a matter of course to the Internal Revenue 
9247,"Service. An amendment to the Treasury Regulations, or modification "
9248,"of the executive order, was not necessary, and in every instance the "
9249,Special Prosecutor received the requested materials without delays. 
9250,CONCLUSION 
9251,"Following the dismissal of Special Prosecutor Cox on October 20, "
9252,"1973, the nature and number of contacts between the new Special "
9253,Prosecutors and new Attorneys General declined sharply for several 
9254,reasons. One was the uniqueness of the pre-existing relationship 
9255,"between Attorney General Richardson and Special Prosecutor Cox, "
9256,which enabled them to deal with each other regularly and easily. 
9257,"In addition, after the discussions in the formative months of the "
9258,"Special Prosecutor's office, most of the structural issues had been re- "
9259,"solved, and questions about the contours of jurisdiction were no "
9260,"longer as significant. Most importantly, the public and congressional "
9261,"reaction to the dismissal of Cox, and to the White House effort to "
9262,"override his independence and to undercut his judgment, would have "
9263,made it very difficult as a political or policy matter for subsequent 
9264,Attorneys General to assume any significant role in directly ques- 
9265,tioning the Special Prosecutors' judgments or even raising issues 
9266,about them.

9269,Appendix E: 
9270,Relations With 
9271,Congressional Committees 
9272,INTRODUCTION 
9273,This Appendix describes the continuing relationships that WSPF 
9274,developed with the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign 
9275,"Activities, and the Senate and House Committees on the Judiciary. "
9276,The relationship with the Senate Select Committee (SSC) arose from 
9277,mutual needs to share information and coordinate often parallel 
9278,investigations. WSPF’s dealings with the House and Senate Judiciary 
9279,Committees grew from the confirmation hearings in which Richardson 
9280,"pledged to establish WSPF. Later, after Cox’s firing the Committee’s "
9281,consideration of various legislative proposals for a special prosecutor 
9282,resulted in the Congressional protection of WSPF’s existence and inde- 
9283,pendence after its reestablishment. 1 
9284,"In addition to these ongoing relationships, WSPF had intermittent "
9285,contact with the Congressional committees that conducted inquiries on 
9286,"matters related to WSPF’s work. Beginning in late May 1973, a "
9287,WSPF staff attorney was assigned to identify and acquire transcripts 
9288,of Congressional hearings on matters of interest to the Special Prose- 
9289,cutor. These eventually included hearings from the following: (1) the 
9290,Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities; 
9291,(2) the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Intelligence Opera- 
9292,tions (regarding CIA assistance to the Plumbers and involvement in 
9293,the burglary of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist’s office and in the Watergate 
9294,cover-up) ; (3) the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Housing 
9295,"and Urban Development, Space, Science, Veterans and other inde- "
9296,pendent executive agencies (regarding the SEC investigation into the 
9297,activities of Robert Vesco) ; (4) the Senate Armed Services Committee 
9298,1 Cooperation between WSPF and the House Judiciary Committee’s impeach- 
9299,ment inquiry staff is described in Chapter 4 of this Report. Appendix B discusses 
9300,the consideration in 1973 of proposals for a legislatively-created special prosecutor. 
9301,"In July 1975, Special Prosecutor Ruth and former Special Prosecutor Jaworski "
9302,testified before the Senate Committee on Government Operations to oppose a bill 
9303,"that would create, in effect, a permanent special prosecutor. "
9304,205
9305,591-439 0 - 75 - 14 
9306,(regarding CIA involvement in domestic intelligence activities); 
9307,"(5) the Senate Commerce Committee (confirmation of Egil Krogh, "
9308,former head of the Plumbers) ; (6) the Senate Foreign Relations Com- 
9309,"mittee (confirmation of Richard Helms, former head of the CIA); "
9310,(7) the Senate Judiciary Committee (regarding ITT and the Richard 
9311,Kleindienst confirmation hearings and regarding the Watergate 
9312,cover-up in the L. Patrick Gray confirmation hearings) ; (8) the House 
9313,Commerce Committee’s Special Subcommittee on Investigations 
9314,(regarding the SEC’s role in the Vesco and ITT matters). WSPF also 
9315,received staff reports from the House Committee on Banking and 
9316,"Currency regarding, among other things, financial aspects of the "
9317,Watergate burglary. The House Armed Services Subcommittee on 
9318,"Intelligence, which had held hearings on CIA involvement in the "
9319,"burglary of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist’s office and the Watergate cover-up, "
9320,originally refused to provide transcripts of its executive session 
9321,hearings. 
9322,"In addition to these sources of information, in April 1974 the "
9323,Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation released a report on 
9324,President Nixon’s tax returns from 1969 through 1972. The report 
9325,was useful to the attorneys from the Special Prosecutor’s office who 
9326,were investigating charitable contribution tax deductions taken by 
9327,"Nixon for his gift of pre-Presidential papers. Also, the staff of the "
9328,Joint Committee cooperated fully with the WSPF attorneys in their 
9329,investigation. 
9330,"As investigations led to prosecutions, the Special Prosecutor’s office "
9331,had to comply with the legal requirement of supplying defense counsel 
9332,with prior statements made by prospective trial witnesses on topics 
9333,they would testify to at trial and any evidence in the Government’s 
9334,possession which tended to exculpate the defendant. Although he was 
9335,convinced that this requirement did not extend to Congressional 
9336,"testimony, the Special Prosecutor, in an effort to be as complete as "
9337,"possible, wrote to a number of Congressional committees requesting "
9338,that they turn over to the prosecutors any relevant executive session 
9339,testimony or staff interviews that they possessed on matters approach- 
9340,ing trial. Most of the committees immediately supplied the relevant 
9341,material in their possession. The House Armed Services Committee 
9342,eventually agreed to provide executive session material of witnesses 
9343,who testified before the Subcommittee on Intelligence relative to the 
9344,Subcommittee’s inquiry into the alleged involvement of the CIA in the 
9345,Watergate and Ellsberg break-ins. The testimony was made available 
9346,for the Watergate cover-up trial. 
9347,"In a few instances, members of Congress and Congressional com- "
9348,mittees referred matters to the Special Prosecutor’s office for in- 
9349,vestigation. Any such allegation that merited full investigation was 
9350,fully pursued. Others either did not fall within WSPF’s jurisdiction 
9351,"or proved to lack potential after initial inquiry. In one instance, a "
9352,206
9353,referral by a committee resulted directly in a conviction. On Septem- 
9354,"ber 10, 1973, after G. Gordon Liddy refused to be sworn in to testify "
9355,before the House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on In- 
9356,"telligence, the House of Representatives voted to cite Liddy for "
9357,contempt of Congress. The case was referred by the U.S. Attorney for 
9358,the District of Columbia to WSPF. Liddy was subsequently indicted 
9359,"on March 7, 1974, for refusing to testify or produce papers before a "
9360,"Congressional committee, and he was found guilty on May 10, 1974. "
9361,The Senate Select Committee on 
9362,Presidential Campaign Activities 
9363,The Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities 
9364,(SSC) was established approximately three months prior to the 
9365,appointment of the Watergate Special Prosecutor. Widespread allega- 
9366,tions of executive misconduct had led the Senate to vote unanimously 
9367,for the creation of a select committee to investigate the Watergate 
9368,"break-in and cover-up, campaign practices and financing, and "
9369,campaign espionage during the 1972 Presidential campaign. 2 
9370,The Committee’s initial dealings with the Department of Justice 
9371,involved requests for access to FBI investigative reports on the 
9372,"Watergate investigation, summaries of which were provided, and "
9373,notices of intent to apply for court orders requiring witnesses to 
9374,testify before the Committee. 3 This caused considerable concern 
9375,to the prosecutors investigating the Watergate case because any 
9376,testimony or evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom could 
9377,not be used against the witness in future prosecutions. A failure to 
9378,prove no “taint” would result in the case being dropped. The SSC’s 
9379,decision to allow live television coverage of the hearings intensified 
9380,the difficulty of such proof and raised the problem of a future claim 
9381,by defendants that pre-trial publicity prevented the empanelling 
9382,of an unbiased jury and the assurance of a fair trial. 
9383,"The SSC public hearings opened on May 17, 1973, a week before "
9384,Cox was sworn in as Special Prosecutor. Cox was immediately faced 
9385,with the problem of publicity generated by the SSC’s hearings and the 
9386,2 The Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities was 
9387,"established under Senate Resolution 60, dated February 7, 1973. "
9388,"3 Under Federal law, a Congressional committee wishing to obtain testimony "
9389,from a witness who refuses to testify on the grounds of his Fifth Amendment 
9390,privilege against self-incrimination must notify the Attorney General ten days 
9391,before seeking a court order compelling the witness to testify. The Attorney 
9392,General cannot prevent the Committee from seeking the order but can ask the 
9393,court for a delay of up to 20 days. When the Committee makes its application 
9394,"to the court, and the court finds that the Attorney General has not exercised "
9395,"his delay option or has done so and 20 days have expired, the court will order "
9396,the witness to testify. The witness is thus “immunized” from any use of his 
9397,testimony against him in criminal investigations or prosecutions. 
9398,207
9399,effect this would have on his criminal investigations and subsequent 
9400,"indictments. On June 2, 1973, the Special Prosecutor met with "
9401,Senator Ervin to request that the SSC temporarily suspend public 
9402,"hearings. Cox then expressed his concern in a June 4, 1973, letter "
9403,to Senator Ervin and requested that the Committee consider two 
9404,"important points: one, the danger that pre-trial publicity might "
9405,"interfere with fair trials; and two, the risk that the Senate Com- "
9406,mittee’s granting immunity to major potential defendants would 
9407,"bar successful prosecution. Senator Ervin responded in a June 5, "
9408,"1973, letter stating that the public hearings would continue. "
9409,"By this time, the SSC had applied to the District Court for orders "
9410,requiring John Dean and Jeb Stuart Magruder to testify. Both Dean 
9411,and Magruder were viewed by Cox as potential defendants. Ervin’s 
9412,letter led the Special Prosecutor to request that the District Court 
9413,impose conditions on these immunity orders. Suggested conditions 
9414,included requiring the exclusion of the broadcast media when Dean 
9415,and Magruder were to testify or taking their testimony in executive 
9416,session. The SSC argued that it was not within the court’s power to 
9417,impose conditions upon the grant of an immunity order. The court 
9418,"ruled that, since its duties in this regard were purely ministerial, it "
9419,had no choice but to grant the Committee’s request. 4 Cox announced 
9420,"that he would not appeal the District Court order, but on June 19, "
9421,"1973, prior to Dean’s testimony before the SSC, he filed with the court "
9422,a list of all the evidence against Dean that had been compiled pre- 
9423,viously by the U.S. Attorneys and WSPF. This was done to protect 
9424,WSPF against future claims by Dean concerning the validity of an 
9425,indictment or admissibility of evidence on the ground that such indict- 
9426,ment or evidence was derived directly or indirectly from testimony 
9427,compelled by the SSC. No “ taint” papers were filed in regard to 
9428,Magruder because he had already agreed with the U.S. Attorneys 
9429,to plead guilty to a one-count information on his involvement in the 
9430,Watergate matter. 
9431,"On June 5, 1973, the Senate Select Committee filed with the court "
9432,a notice of intent to apply for an order conferring immunity and 
9433,compelling the testimony of Gordon Strachan. In an accompanying 
9434,"letter to the Attorney General, Majority Counsel Sam Dash requested "
9435,a waiver of the 10-day notice period as well as the additional 20-day 
9436,"extension granted by law. Richardson referred the matter to Cox, "
9437,as the Attorney General had already delegated to the Special Prose- 
9438,cutor his authority over immunity applications by the SSC. 
9439,"On June 8, 1973, Cox’s assistants, James Neal and James Voren- "
9440,"berg, discussed with Dash and Minority Counsel Fred Thompson the "
9441,"Special Prosecutor’s concerns about immunizing Strachan, stating "
9442,4 Application of U.S. Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign 
9443,"Activities, 361 F. Supp. 1270 (D.D.C. 1973). "
9444,that more investigation was needed before they would be able to 
9445,determine if Strachan was a potential defendant. Time was also needed 
9446,to isolate the evidence against Strachan as was being done with respect 
9447,to Dean. It was agreed that since the SSC would not schedule 
9448,"Strachan’s testimony for about a month, WSPF would invoke the "
9449,20-day extension granted by law and take the matter up at the end of 
9450,"that period. On July 5, the Special Prosecutor notified the District "
9451,Court that WSPF was not opposed to the SSC's request for an order 
9452,compelling Strachan to testify and the court granted the order on 
9453,"July 6, 1973. Prior to Strachan's testimony before the SSC, the Special "
9454,Prosecutor filed with the court a list of the evidence against him com- 
9455,piled by WSPF. 
9456,In regard to those witnesses who were testifying before the Select 
9457,Committee without grants of immunity and who were viewed by 
9458,"WSPF as potential defendants, Cox suggested in a letter to Senator "
9459,Ervin (concerning the SSC's scheduling of John MitchelPs testimony) 
9460,that the Committee advise the witness of his status in the investiga- 
9461,"tion, inform him of his rights and make it clear that “any testimony "
9462,that he gives . . . without invoking his privilege against self- 
9463,incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Con- 
9464,stitution constitutes a waiver of that privilege” and that the waiver 
9465,was not the result of compulsion. 
9466,"After Alexander Butterfield testified before the SSC on July 16, "
9467,"1973, about the existence of the White House taping system, the "
9468,Special Prosecutor and Senate Select Committee both subpoenaed 
9469,tapes of certain conversations that they felt were vital to their Water- 
9470,gate investigations. The President refused to comply with the sub- 
9471,poenas and both the Special Prosecutor and the SSC initiated litigation 
9472,"to force compliance. In an August 22, 1973, letter to Judge Sirica, "
9473,"Sam Dash attempted to have the SSC's case ( SSC v. Nixon, CA "
9474,1593-73) and the Special Prosecutor's case (In Re Grand Jury Sub- 
9475,"poena Duces Tecum Issued to Richard Nixon, Misc. No. 47-73) con- "
9476,"sidered together. Both Cox and the President's counsel, Charles Alan "
9477,"Wright, noting the differences between the two cases on central issues, "
9478,opposed the Committee's request. Since the District Court had already 
9479,"scheduled a hearing for August 22 on Cox's case, the Special Prosecutor "
9480,was also concerned about possible delay in grand jury proceedings. 
9481,The District Court decided not to consider the cases jointly and 
9482,"on October 17, 1973, dismissed the Committee's suit for lack of "
9483,jurisdiction. 
9484,Representatives of the Senate Select Committee were then drawn 
9485,into the dispute over the President's insistence that the courts could 
9486,not order him to provide tapes subpoenaed from the White House by 
9487,"the Special Prosecutor. On October 19, 1973, the same day the Com- "
9488,mittee filed an appeal from the District Court's dismissal of their 
9489,"tapes suit and the day before the Special Prosecutor was fired, Senators "
9490,209
9491,Ervin and Baker were called to the White House to meet with the 
9492,President and his counsel. The President first met with Baker alone 
9493,and then met with Baker and Ervin to discuss a solution to the tapes 
9494,"issue. After the meetings, the President announced that Cox had "
9495,refused to accept a compromise on the tapes worked out between 
9496,"Attorney General Richardson, Senators Ervin and Baker and the "
9497,White House. 
9498,Initial press reports indicated that Ervin and Baker had agreed 
9499,to drop their litigation in exchange for summaries of certain tapes to 
9500,be verified by Senator Stennis . 5 Outrage by members of the SSC that 
9501,they had not been consulted led Ervin to explain that an oral proposal 
9502,had been made and that Ervin and Baker had agreed to present the 
9503,"compromise to the Committee . 6 Both expressed shock, however, on "
9504,learning that their agreement was tied to Cox’s dismissal. Ervin 
9505,stated that his and Baker’s agreement had nothing to do with Cox’s 
9506,attempt to gain access to the tapes and later affirmed his understand- 
9507,ing that the President was offering the Committee verbatim tran- 
9508,"scripts, not mere summaries. At any rate, before the SSC had a chance "
9509,"to clarify the situation, the White House withdrew its proposal; on "
9510,"October 23, 1973, White House Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig, "
9511,announced that the “Stennis Compromise” reached on October 19 
9512,with Senators Ervin and Baker had been cancelled as a result of the 
9513,President’s decision to turn the subpoenaed tapes over to the District 
9514,Court for the grand jury. 
9515,"Meanwhile, the Senate Select Committee continued to press the "
9516,"case for compliance with its subponea. On December 28, 1973, the "
9517,Court of Appeals for D.C. reversed the District Court’s determination 
9518,"that it had no jurisdiction over the case, and remanded the case back "
9519,"to the District Court. Then, on January 25, 1974, the District Court "
9520,requested the Special Prosecutor to file a statement concerning the 
9521,effect of compliance with the SSC’s subpoena for five specified tapes 
9522,on future actions by the Special Prosecutor’s office. 
9523,"The memorandum filed by the Special Prosecutor on February 6, "
9524,"1974, reflected a compromise position. While admitting that compli- "
9525,ance with the SSC’s subpoena would add one more factual incident of 
9526,"pre-trial publicity, but one not nearly sufficient to prevent the court "
9527,"from empanelling an unbiased jury, WSPF took no affirmative stance "
9528,"against enforcement of the subpoena. On February 8, 1974, the "
9529,District Court declined to enforce the SSC’s subpoena and dismissed 
9530,"the litigation. Once again, the Committee appealed the District "
9531,"Court’s dismissal and on May 23, 1974, the Court of Appeals affirmed "
9532,that decision. 
9533,"5 SSC Final Report, July 1974, 93d Cong. 2d Sess., p. 1081. "
9534,"6 Part I, Special Prosecutor Hearings, Senate Judiciary Committee, p. 49. "
9535,The SSC was originally scheduled to submit a final report of its 
9536,"findings and recommendations on February 28, 1974. However, in "
9537,early February it was announced that it would delay its report so 
9538,as not to prejudice potential jurors in forthcoming trials. Special 
9539,"Prosecutor Jaworski had also expressed concern, in a December 11, "
9540,"1973, letter to Senator Ervin and in a meeting on January 31, 1974, "
9541,"with Senators Ervin and Baker, that the Report not include factual "
9542,"conclusions, at least insofar as any assessment of criminality of persons "
9543,"who could be defendants in a later jury trial. Also, on February 19, "
9544,"1974, the SSC voted unanimously to hold no further public hearings "
9545,to avoid interfering with the House Judiciary Committee’s inquiry 
9546,into the impeachment of Richard Nixon and with the trials of 
9547,Watergate-related figures. Hearings concerning remaining matters 
9548,"under investigation, including the circumstances surrounding a "
9549,"$100,000 contribution given by agents of Howard Hughes to the "
9550,"President’s friend Charles (“Bebe”) Rebozo, 7 and campaign contri- "
9551,"butions from the dairy industry, were held in closed sessions. "
9552,An important aspect of the relationship between WSPF and the 
9553,SSC was the exchange of information between the two. Early SSC 
9554,requests to the Justice Department for access to documents were 
9555,referred to the Special Prosecutor’s office and a procedure was estab- 
9556,lished for the SSC to gain access to some documents in the Special 
9557,Prosecutor’s possession. The SSC submitted to WSPF an inventory 
9558,of the material collected by the SSC in regard to specific individuals. 
9559,WSPF would then indicate that it possessed additional documents 
9560,and from whom the documents were obtained. The SSC would either 
9561,seek to have a witness consent to their receiving the material or apply 
9562,for a court order. 
9563,WSPF obtained material from the SSC pursuant to an agreement 
9564,reached between Cox and Ervin in September 1973. Two WSPF 
9565,"attorneys reviewed the SSC’s master inventory of witness statements, "
9566,documents and evidence to locate information necessary for investiga- 
9567,tions. The SSC then provided some of the materials requested by the 
9568,Special Prosecutor. Documents were also acquired by means of in- 
9569,"formal contacts, later confirmed in writing, between staff members of "
9570,the WSPF and SSC. 
9571,"In a February 22, 1974, letter to Senator Ervin, Special Prosecutor "
9572,Jaworski requested access to the SSC’s investigative and executive 
9573,session materials. The SSC complied with the request and also pro- 
9574,7 The Senate Select Committee undertook an extensive investigation into the 
9575,Hughes-Rebozo matter. Documents acquired during their investigation were 
9576,"supplied to the Special Prosecutor's office, including interviews and executive "

9580,"receive certain immunized testimony (Strachan, De Diego, Martinez "
9581,and Barker) due to problems that could arise with respect to using 
9582,“tainted” testimony. 
9583,"During the spring and summer of 1974, WSPF continued to request "
9584,documents from the SSC relating (1) to trials it was engaged in ( U.S. 
9585,"v. Chapin , U.S. v. Ehrlichman, U.S. v. Mitchell , U.S. v. Connally ), "
9586,"(2) to SSC investigations such as Hughes- Rebozo, (3) to documents "
9587,underlying Senator Baker’s report on Cl A- Watergate connections 
9588,and (4) to interviews and executive session testimony of numerous 
9589,individuals. 
9590,"The SSC’s Final Report was released on July 13, 1974, and a few "
9591,months later the Committee formally closed down operations. Docu- 
9592,"ments acquired by the Committee, however, were still of interest to "
9593,"the Special Prosecutor’s office. Pursuant to S. Res. 369, exclusive "
9594,access to aDd use of the SSC files was granted to the Senate Rules 
9595,Committee pending file transfer to the National Archives. WSPF 
9596,was able to acquire SSC documents through requests to the Senate 
9597,"Rules Committee. In addition, the Senate Rules Committee honored "
9598,requests by WSPF that certain categories of documents temporarily 
9599,be withheld from public distribution to protect the rights of individuals 
9600,involved in upcoming trials or pending investigations. 
9601,"The Senate Judiciary Committee, "

9603,and House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice 
9604,The Senate Judiciary Committee had received assurances from 
9605,Elliot Richardson during his confirmation hearings in May 1973 that 
9606,the Special Prosecutor would operate independently and would have 
9607,full responsibility for investigations under his jurisdiction. Five months 
9608,"later, following the firing of Archibald Cox and the abolition of WSPF, "
9609,the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Judiciary Com- 
9610,mittee’s Subcommittee on Criminal Justice considered legislation 
9611,calling for the appointment of an independent Special Prosecutor. 
9612,"Although no legislation was passed, the introduction of the Special "
9613,Prosecutor bills and the determination of the two committees to hold 
9614,hearings on the proposals added to the pressure on President Nixon 
9615,to reinstate the complete independence of WSPF. A provision was 
9616,added to the charter stipulating that the Special Prosecutor could 
9617,not be dismissed without the President’s obtaining the consensus of 
9618,the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate and the

9625,"Prior to considering the Special Prosecutor legislation, which is "
9626,"discussed in Appendix B, the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, "
9627,"chaired by Congressman William Hungate, heard testimony on legisla- "
9628,"tion to extend the grand jury empanelled on June 5, 1972. This grand "
9629,"jury, which had been investigating the Watergate break-in and "
9630,"cover-up, was due to expire on December 4, 1973, at the end of its "
9631,regular 18-month term. There was widespread backing for extension 
9632,of the grand jury’s term in order to avoid the delay in completing its 
9633,investigations which would have resulted if the prosecutors had to 
9634,present great masses of evidence to a new grand jury. 
9635,The Subcommittee favorably reported to the full Committee a 
9636,"bill that extended the June 5, 1972, grand jury for six months and "
9637,provided for another six month extension if the U.S. District Court 
9638,for the District of Columbia determined that the business of the 
9639,"grand jury would not be completed by June 4, 1974. The bill was "
9640,reported by the full Committee to the House and passed by the House 
9641,"of Representatives on November 6, 1973. After Senate approval, the "
9642,"bill was signed by President Nixon on November 30, 1973 (P.L. "
9643,93-172). 9 
9644,The Senate Judiciary Committee had virtually no contact with 
9645,the Special Prosecutor between the hearings on the nomination of 
9646,Elliot Richardson to be Attorney General and the resignation of 
9647,Richardson and firing of Cox. After Leon Jaworski’s appointment as 
9648,"the second Special Prosecutor, the Committee assumed a guardian "
9649,"posture over WSPF’s work. Cox, the first witness at the hearings on "
9650,"the Special Prosecutor bills, had told the Committee of his frustration "
9651,over White House failure to provide evidence needed in the Watergate 
9652,"investigations. On November 5, Chairman James Eastland wrote to "
9653,Acting Attorney General Robert Bork to request a list of all materials 
9654,Cox had requested from the White House and an indication of which 
9655,materials had been provided and which refused. Bork referred the 
9656,"letter to Jaworski, who sent to Eastland, in confidence, a copy of each "
9657,request Cox had made and a report on those which had not been met. 
9658,When Jaworski testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on 
9659,"legislative proposals for a special prosecutor, Senator Charles Mathias "
9660,asked that he submit to the Committee a report on the status of all 
9661,requests for evidence from the White House. This request was formal- 
9662,ized in a letter from the Chairman to Jaworski a week later. Jaworski 
9663,"9 The additional six month extension, determined necessary by the Special "
9664,"Prosecutor’s office and the grand jury, was granted by Chief Judge Hart on May "
9665,"31, 1974. The June 5, 1972, grand jury investigated the Watergate break-in and "
9666,"cover-up until its expiration on December 4, 1974; the members had served longer "
9667,than any Federal grand jury in the Nation’s history. 
9668,213
9669,responded that some items had been received and that discussions 
9670,with White House counsel over other items were planned. Two 
9671,"months later, Jaworski submitted to the Chairman a full report on "
9672,"the results of the discussions. In March, thanking Jaworski for his "
9673,February report on the status of efforts to obtain evidence from the 
9674,"White House, Eastland wrote : "
9675,We welcome your continued provision to the Committee of any 
9676,information or advice in the progress of your investigation which 
9677,you think would be appropriate to the Committee's oversight 
9678,responsibility or helpful for the performance of the duties with 
9679,which you have been charged. 
9680,"In accordance with this, and with Jaworski's pledge to the House "
9681,Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and the Senate Judiciary Commit- 
9682,tee that he would inform both committees of White House attempts 
9683,"to limit his jurisdiction and independence, Jaworski wrote to Chairman "
9684,"Eastland on May 20, 1974. In the letter, a copy of which was sent to "
9685,Chairman Peter Rodino and Ranking Minority Member Edward 
9686,"Hutchinson of the House Judiciary Committee, Jaworski advised "
9687,"Eastland that Presidential counsel James St. Clair, in a closed hearing "
9688,on Jaworski's subpoena of Presidential tape recordings for use in the 
9689,"Watergate cover-up trial, had claimed that Jaworski, as a member of "
9690,"the executive branch, had no right to subpoena the President. Jaworski "
9691,"reminded Eastland that Alexander Haig, after consulting with the "
9692,"President, had promised Jaworski he would have the right to press "
9693,legal proceedings against the President. Jaworski reported that 
9694,"Judge Sirica had overruled the White House claim. The next day, "
9695,"May 21, 1974, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed a resolution "
9696,expressing support for Jaworski's jurisdiction to seek the tape 
9697,recordings. 
9698,Jaworski's claim to the tapes was upheld by the Supreme Court 
9699,"on July 24, 1974. Two weeks later, President Nixon resigned, and on "
9700,"September 8, 1974, he was granted an unconditional pardon by Presi- "
9701,dent Ford for all criminal acts he may have committed while he was 
9702,President. Nixon's resignation led the House of Representatives to 
9703,"drop pending impeachment proceedings, and the pardon was an effec- "
9704,tive bar to any possible criminal charges against him. 
9705,Fearing that all the facts of Nixon's involvement in Watergate 
9706,"would never be revealed, eight members of the Senate Judiciary "
9707,Committee wrote Jaworski that they felt it was his responsibility to 
9708,report to Congress fully on the evidence obtained in the course of his 
9709,"investigations, including a full and complete record detailing any "
9710,involvement of Nixon. Jaworski responded that although the matter 
9711,"was under study, he thought he had no authority to issue such a "
9712,detailed report. 
9713,"The Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, which had virtually "
9714,no contact with the Special Prosecutor following the hearings on 
9715,214
9716,"grand jury extension and Special Prosecutor legislation, assumed "
9717,an oversight posture as to WSPF following the pardon of Richard 
9718,Nixon. The concern of the Subcommittee that all the evidence relating 
9719,to former President Nixon’s involvement in Wategate would never 
9720,be revealed led them to seek assurance from the Special Prosecutor 
9721,that the former President’s tapes and documents would remain under 
9722,White House control until Congress considered legislative proposals 
9723,"to deal with the issue. Jaworski responded in a September 24, 1974, "
9724,letter to Chairman Hungate that the Special Prosecutor’s office had 
9725,requested the Ford Administration to take no steps to disturb the 
9726,location or custody of Nixon’s tapes and documents. Congress even- 
9727,"tually passed, and President Ford signed into law, the Presidential "
9728,Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (P.L. 93-526) on Dec- 
9729,"ember 19, 1974. 10 "
9730,The concern that former President Nixon’s full involvement in 
9731,Watergate would not be revealed also led to the introduction in Con- 
9732,gress of a number of bills requiring the Special Prosecutor to publish 
9733,a report detailing all evidence concerning the involvement of Richard 
9734,Nixon in any criminal offense. Much of this legislation was introduced 
9735,in the fall of 1974 following President Ford’s pardon of Nixon and 
9736,referred to the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice. Several sponsors 
9737,of the proposed legislation appeared before the Subcommittee at that 
9738,time and were unanimous in stating that their overriding purpose 
9739,in introducing the legislation was to insure that a complete record 
9740,of Watergate and its related events be made public. No action on the 
9741,proposed legislation was taken during the 93d Congress. 
9742,"On January 30, 1975, at the start of the 94th Congress, the Hungate "
9743,"Subcommittee heard testimony from Special Prosecutor Henry Ruth, "
9744,"former Special Prosecutor Jaworski and James Vorenberg, consultant "
9745,"to the Special Prosecutor, to determine whether such legislation "
9746,"should still be considered. In his testimony, Ruth expressed doubt "
9747,about the constitutionality of legislation authorizing the dissemination 
9748,of evidence on Richard Nixon’s role in the Watergate affair. He 
9749,pointed out that it would be impossible for WSPF to compfy with 
9750,such legislation without releasing raw data involving persons other 
9751,than Nixon and that such a release would violate the legal rights of 
9752,all those involved. Ruth added that the basic Watergate cover-up 
9753,evidence against the former President had been made public through 
9754,"the impeachment proceedings, the hearings of the Senate Select "
9755,"Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, and the trials of "
9756,Watergate-related figures. 
9757,10 The law directs the General Services Administration to make public all 
9758,papers bearing on Presidential abuses of power. Former President Nixon is con- 
9759,"testing the constitutionality of this law, claiming that the papers are his property. "
9760,215
9761,Jaworski and Vorenberg supported Ruth’s position in their testi- 
9762,"mony. Jaworski, expanding on his earlier response to the Senate "
9763,"Judiciary Committee about a detailed report, stated that he did not "
9764,believe that the release of a report on matters that did not involve the 
9765,filing of charges was part of the prosecution function. Vorenberg 
9766,"concurred, stating that the only way a prosecutor ought to speak about "
9767,individuals under investigation was through the grand jury and a 
9768,"formal indictment. If an investigation did not lead to that, it would "
9769,be a violation of an individual’s rights for a prosecutor to disclose the 
9770,information he had gathered. 
9771,In light of the arguments by the prosecutors against the proposed 
9772,"bills that would require release of raw investigative files, the Sub- "
9773,committee on Criminal Justice decided not to proceed with legisla- 
9774,tion that would specify what WSPF reports should contain. 
9775,"In July 1975, the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice requested "
9776,Ruth to testify concerning the termination of the office and publicized 
9777,allegations that remained unresolved. The session was closed to the 
9778,public to protect the rights of persons who may have been investi- 
9779,"gated but not indicted. In his publicly released opening statement, "
9780,Congressman Hungate stated that the purpose of the meeting was 
9781,“ . . . to fulfill [the Subcommittee’s] oversight responsibility and to 
9782,satisfy the legitimate concern of the public and the Congress that a 
9783,complete and thorough investigation has been conducted.” The Sub- 
9784,"committee, he said, also sought “ ... to insure that the Special "
9785,Prosecutor’s final report will be as complete an account of Watergate 
9786,as possible without prejudicing or injuring the rights of innocent 
9787,persons and that it will be widely available to the public.” 
9788,Special Prosecutor Ruth responded to the Subcommittee’s ques- 
9789,"tions concerning the termination of the Special Prosecutor’s office, "
9790,"the thoroughness of investigations, the composition of the final report "
9791,and the disposition of documents and other evidence.

9799,"At the time Cox was appointed Special Prosecutor, the FBI had "
9800,been working on various aspects of the Watergate break-in and 
9801,cover-up for almost a year. One of Cox’s most difficult early decisions 
9802,was whether to use the FBI as his principal investigative arm or to 
9803,"hire his own investigative staff. This required him to determine, at an "
9804,"early stage of his investigation, how thorough the original FBI inves- "
9805,"tigation had been, the extent of FBI involvement, if any, in the "
9806,Watergate cover-up and whether such involvement was so extensive 
9807,and so pervasive as to prevent the FBI from continuing the investiga- 
9808,tion under the new Special Prosecutor. 
9809,The FBI’s possible involvement in many of the matters under 
9810,"investigation by the new Special Prosecutor was, by the time of "
9811,"Cox’s appointment, a subject of public debate. Already on the public "
9812,"record were disclosures that former Acting FBI Director, L. Patrick "
9813,"Gray, had destroyed documents from E. Howard Hunt’s White House "
9814,"safe, reports of White House interference in the Watergate investiga- "
9815,tion and attempts to halt the investigation on bogus national security 
9816,"grounds, the intimidating presence of White House lawyers during "
9817,"FBI interviews with White House and CRP staff members, copies of "
9818,"FBI investigative reports sent to the White House, questionable wire- "
9819,"tapping requests to the FBI by White House officials, requests for "
9820,"FBI investigations of White House “enemies,” and hints of other "
9821,questionable actions by former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. James 
9822,"McCord, one of the Watergate burglars, implied that there might be "
9823,"trouble with the FBI when he said in his March 23, 1973, letter to "
9824,Judge Sirica that he was writing because “I cannot feel confident in 
9825,talking with an FBI agent.” 
9826,212
9827,"On May 30, 1973, shortly after arriving in Washington to take up "
9828,"his duties as Special Prosecutor, Cox sent a memorandum to the "
9829,Director of the FBI requesting a full rundown on all FBI actions 
9830,pertaining to Watergate. This request asked for a specific description 
9831,"of all investigations on matters within his jurisdiction, a full chrono- "
9832,logical account of all internal requests or instructions about the 
9833,"Watergate investigation, a list of all communications within the "
9834,"Justice Department on the Watergate investigation, any communica- "
9835,"tions between the White House and the FBI on Watergate, and a "
9836,chronological listing of all contacts between the FBI and the CIA 
9837,concerning Watergate. 
9838,Cox wished to learn about the FBFs role in the Watergate investi- 
9839,gation in order to make an informed judgment whether or not the FBI 
9840,had participated in the cover-up of the Watergate affair or had suc- 
9841,cumbed to outside pressure and had not been diligent in pursuing the 
9842,investigation. 
9843,"One proposal, considered in the first few days of WSPF, called for "
9844,the hiring of ten staff investigators who could report directly to the 
9845,"Special Prosecutor. However, after Cox weighed all the evidence, "
9846,"including the FBI's memorandum in response to his request, he "
9847,decided to continue use of the FBI to conduct investigations under the 
9848,direction of WSPF prosecutors if he could develop satisfactory working 
9849,arrangements with the Bureau. 
9850,One important factor in this decision was the appointment of 
9851,William Ruckelshaus as Acting Director of the FBI after Gray's 
9852,resignation. Ruckelshaus was not tainted in any way by earlier alleged 
9853,"misconduct within the Bureau, and he was forthright and helpful in "
9854,his dealings with the new Prosecutor. There also appeared to be no 
9855,basis for doubting the integrity or diligence of the agents who had 
9856,actually conducted the investigations to date and who would pre- 
9857,sumably be the ones to continue this work under the direction of the 
9858,Special Prosecutor. 
9859,"Furthermore, Cox took account of the fact that the FBI (1) had "
9860,"become familiar with most aspects of the earlier investigations, (2) had "
9861,"conducted interviews with most of the participants, (3) had the "
9862,resources and broad investigative experience to conduct the Special 
9863,Prosecutor’s investigations with maximum efficiency and least addi- 
9864,"tional financial burden to the Government, and (4) had agents in all "
9865,parts of the country. If the Special Prosecutor had hired his own 
9866,"investigators, they would be going over the same ground, for the fore- "
9867,"seeable future, that the FBI had already covered. Also, staff investi- "
9868,gators hired by and reporting directly to the Special Prosecutor might 
9869,prove difficult to supervise as they moved around the country con- 
9870,ducting investigations in the name of the Watergate Prosecutor. Using 
9871,"the FBI, in short, avoided duplication and seemed to make it more "
9872,218
9873,"likely that investigators would be experienced, esponsible and famil- "
9874,iar with the geographical area in which they were working. 
9875,A number of meetings were held with FBI officials in June 1973 
9876,to discuss arrangements for the FBI’s continued participation. WSPF 
9877,was anxious to avoid having investigative requests and the results of 
9878,investigations follow normal FBI channels through the Department 
9879,of Justice. There had been too much interference with FBI operations 
9880,"during the early phase of the original investigation, and WSPF "
9881,recognized that even without future interference there would be 
9882,special problems since past actions of the Bureau would be involved 
9883,in the investigations. Cox obtained agreement that written investiga- 
9884,"tive requests would proceed directly from WSPF to the FBI, and "
9885,written FBI investigative reports would proceed directly back to 
9886,"WSPF. In addition, WSPF attorneys could deal directly with "
9887,individual FBI agents rather than having to request further work 
9888,"only through normal FBI supervisory channels. Finally, the FBI "
9889,"agreed to expedite all work for the Special Prosecutor, and no reports "
9890,would be sent to the Attorney General unless the Special Prosecutor 
9891,so approved in matters of possible overlap with Criminal Division 
9892,responsibilities. 
9893,While office interviews of witnesses and prospective defendants 
9894,"were conducted by WSPF staff attorneys, most field interviews were "
9895,conducted by FBI agents. 1 Agents from the Washington Field Office 
9896,continued to work on the Watergate cover-up investigation and 
9897,maintained a close working relationship with the WSPF staff. Other 
9898,"interviews, requests for assistance in locating persons, checking "
9899,"addresses and telephone numbers, and locating and gaining access "
9900,to various documents were also performed by agents in other field 
9901,offices. 
9902,"The FBI also was asked to provide fingerprint analyses, to conduct "
9903,"laboratory tests, and, on a number of occasions, to perform polygraph "
9904,"examinations for WSPF. Although, as indicated above, WSPF had "
9905,authority to make requests directly to FBI agents working on investi- 
9906,"gations, most requests in areas other than the cover-up investigation "
9907,were made through memoranda to the FBI Director. Other requests 
9908,were made more informally by telephone to agents of the Washington 
9909,Field Office and later confirmed by memoranda. 
9910,"In a few matters, assessment of the conduct of FBI agents was "
9911,"part of WSPF’s investigative task. In these cases, the investigating "
9912,attorneys handled the matter exclusively in the grand jury or special 
9913,arrangements were made with the Director of the FBI for any investi- 
9914,gative assistance. Some of these matters were also under investigation 
9915,by the Inspections Division of the Bureau and these dual responsi- 
9916,"bilities required coordination. For example, in WSPF’s inquiry into "
9917,1 The investigative process is described in Chapter 2 of this^ report. 
9918,219
9919,"the national security wiretap program, which was implemented by "
9920,"the FBI at the direction of the White House and the Attorney General, "
9921,the Special Prosecutor arranged with Director Kelley of the Bureau 
9922,to use the FBPs General Investigative Division rather than the 
9923,Intelligence Division which normally conducts national security 
9924,"investigations, but which housed some of the personnel through "
9925,whom the White House wiretap program had proceeded. This investi- 
9926,"gative procedure avoided any conflict of interest, or appearance "
9927,"thereof, that otherwise might have clouded the required thoroughness "
9928,and cooperation. 
9929,"In summary, although the FBI was not involved in some of the "
9930,"investigations WSPF conducted, and played only a small part in "
9931,"others, its work in the great majority of individual matters investi- "
9932,"gated by WSPF was quite extensive. In all, agents from 58 of the "
9933,Bureau’s 59 field offices conducted more than 2600 interviews at the 
9934,Special Prosecutor’s request. This work included FBI employees in 
9935,several of the FBI “legal attache” offices overseas. 
9936,Internal Revenue Service 
9937,Continuing liaison developed during the summer of 1973 between 
9938,the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Special Prosecutor’s 
9939,office. The relations pertained for the most part to three areas of 
9940,joint interest. 
9941,"First, IRS commenced its own project to ferret out any tax viola- "
9942,"tions committed by donors or recipients of campaign contributions, "
9943,"primarily in the 1972 Presidential campaign. For example, corpora- "
9944,tions that used corporate funds for such contributions may have 
9945,deducted that expense improperly from their gross income. Other con- 
9946,"tributions may have involved evasion of gift tax laws, and recipients "
9947,who used contributions for personal expenses may have owed income 
9948,"tax on such funds. As WSPF developed its own investigations, the "
9949,sharing of information with IRS became a daily event. When WSPF 
9950,agreed to accept a guilty plea from an individual or corporation in a 
9951,"campaign contribution case, prosecutors insisted that the defendant "
9952,corporation disclose all corporate contributions to candidates for 
9953,Federal office within the period of the applicable statute of limitations; 
9954,and the Special Prosecutor also required disclosure of the basic method 
9955,"each defendant had used to generate the contributed funds, including "
9956,cash accumulations in “slush funds” (usually from overseas sources) 
9957,and the use of bonus payments and expense accounts to reimburse 
9958,employees for contributions made in their own names. Most of the 
9959,guilty pleas from corporate or individual defendants did not relieve 
9960,the defendants from civil and criminal liability under the tax laws. 
9961,"As a result, WSPF furnished IRS with great quantities of information "
9962,that IRS then used in their campaign contribution project. 
9963,The second area of WSPF-IRS cooperation was the tax agency’s 
9964,project to audit the tax returns of individuals who received accumula- 
9965,tions of cash during the Watergate years. The IRS agents sought to 
9966,determine whether or not any of the cash was converted to personal 
9967,use and not reported as income on the relevant individual’s tax return. 
9968,"Finally, the Special Prosecutor’s office used IRS as the principal "
9969,investigators in some of the major investigative matters. Two of 
9970,these are described in Chapter 3 of this report: the Hughes-Rebozo 
9971,allegations and the inquiry into the conduct of those who participated 
9972,in President Nixon’s alleged gift of pre-Presidential papers and in the 
9973,related large tax deduction taken by Mr. Nixon for the alleged gift. 
9974,When IRS completed a criminal tax investigation and recom- 
9975,"mended either further grand jury action or prosecution, the case was "
9976,sent to WSPF which could decide either to handle the tax case within 
9977,the Special Prosecutor’s office or forward it to the Tax Division of the 
9978,Department of Justice. The case involving President Nixon’s tax 
9979,returns was specifically delegated to WSPF by the IRS Commissioner 
9980,"and by the Attorney General for grand jury investigation; however, "
9981,other tax cases were forwarded by WSPF to the Tax Division for 
9982,consideration under their usual policies for tax prosecutions. 
9983,"The Special Prosecutor requested, and the IRS Commissioner "
9984,"agreed to, the assignment of an IRS agent directly to the WSPF staff. "
9985,Anthony Passaretti of New York — who had worked with WSPF 
9986,attorneys previously employed in a U.S. Attorney’s office — was 
9987,assigned in June 1974 to assist the prosecutors in a number of investi- 
9988,gations. Several other IRS agents were placed on temporary duty at 
9989,WSPF. These agents assisted attorneys in identifying possible ap- 
9990,proaches to investigations or furnishing professional auditing as- 
9991,sistance to pinpoint possible areas of illegal activity. 
9992,Passaretti worked closely with attorneys in the Campaign Con- 
9993,"tributions Task Force and helped other task forces to trace cash flows, "
9994,investigate Federal income tax returns and examine bank records. 
9995,He developed for the Watergate Task Force a chart showing the flow 
9996,of so-called “hush money” as it passed from officials of the Committee 
9997,to Re-Elect the President and White House staff members through 
9998,intermediaries to the original Watergate defendants. He was a witness 
9999,for the Government in United States v. Mitchell et al. r testifying on the 
10000,flow of this money. 
10001,Part of the investigative work of WSPF required the use of Federal 
10002,income tax returns. These were supplied to the office by IRS with 
10003,the approval of the Attorney General. Within the Special Prosecutor’s 
10004,"office, access to these returns was limited to those attorneys actively "
10005,engaged in the investigation on a “need-to-know” basis. 
10006,In order to permit IRS agents to review grand jury testimony for 
10007,"possible investigative leads, court orders authorizing such disclosure "
10008,221
10009,591-439 0 - 75 - 15 
10010,under Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were 
10011,obtained. 
10012,RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PROSECUTORS 
10013,United States Attorneys 2 
10014,"On May 31, 1973, at Cox’s request, Attorney General Elliot "
10015,Richardson issued a directive to all Department of Justice personnel 
10016,advising them of the creation of the Office of Watergate Special Prose- 
10017,cution Force and the appointment of Archibald Cox as Special Pros- 
10018,ecutor in charge of that office. The directive stated : 
10019,"Effective immediately, all Divisions, Offices, Services, and "
10020,"Bureaus of the Department, including the Federal Bureau of "
10021,"Investigation and all United States Attorneys, will report to and "
10022,cooperate with the Special Prosecutor on all matters within his 
10023,jurisdiction. 
10024,The Special Prosecutor’s jurisdiction included offenses arising out of 
10025,the unauthorized entry into Democratic National Committee Head- 
10026,"quarters on June 17, 1972, all offenses arising out of the 1972 Presi- "
10027,dential election over which the Special Prosecutor deemed it necessary 
10028,"and appropriate to assume responsibility, and allegations involving "
10029,"the President, members of the White House staff, or Presidential "
10030,appointees. Department employees were directed to make prompt 
10031,"written reports to the Special Prosecutor on all allegations, pending "
10032,"investigations, or pending cases falling within these categories. Those "
10033,working on any such matters were directed to continue their work 
10034,but to consult with the Special Prosecutor before making any signifi- 
10035,cant decisions and to furnish copies of their investigative files to the 
10036,Special Prosecutor’s office. 
10037,Several of the major investigations and pending cases which be- 
10038,came the Special Prosecutor’s responsibility came to him from United 
10039,States Attorney’s offices. The office for the District of Columbia was 
10040,handling post-trial issues involving the seven men who had been 
10041,convicted of the Watergate break-in and was investigating the alleged 
10042,cover-up by high officials of the White House and the President’s 
10043,"1972 campaign committee. In addition, that office had begun an "
10044,investigation into evidence suggesting that White House officials had 
10045,"been responsible for a break-in at the office of Dr. Lewis Fielding, "
10046,the psychiatrist of antiwar activist Daniel Ellsberg. 
10047,The U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York 
10048,"had obtained an indictment of former CRP chairman John Mitchell, "
10049,2 WSPF’s relationship with the United States Attorney’s office for the District 
10050,of Columbia is covered separately in Appendix C. WSPF also had extensive con- 
10051,"tact with the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, as described in "
10052,Appendix D. 
10053,222
10054,"CRP finance chairman Maurice Stans, financier Robert Yesco, and "
10055,"Vesco associate Harry Sears. The indictment, returned on May 10, "
10056,"1973, charged that Mitchell, Stans and Sears conspired to influence "
10057,a Securities and Exchange Commission fraud investigation of Robert 
10058,"Yesco in exchange for Vesco’s secret $200,000 contribution to CRP. "
10059,An indictment of Donald Segretti and George Hearing for distributing 
10060,fraudulent campaign materials had been obtained by the U.S. Attor- 
10061,"ney^ office for the Middle District of Florida on May 4, 1973. Other "
10062,U.S. Attorneys’ offices had opened investigations into possible illegal 
10063,campaign contributions. 
10064,"Under WSPF’s charter, Cox had authority to determine whether "
10065,to leave these investigations and cases in the hands of the U.S. 
10066,"Attorneys under his general supervision, or to transfer them to his "
10067,"own staff. By mid-June 1973, Cox or one of his senior aides had dis- "
10068,cussed each of these matters with the U.S. Attorneys’ offices involved. 
10069,Cox decided that he should take over the Segretti case 3 and most of 
10070,the campaign contributions investigations. Among the considerations 
10071,that led to this decision were the fact that the Special Prosecutor’s 
10072,office was better situated than the U.S. Attorneys’ offices to determine 
10073,the extent to which each of these matters was part of a broader oper- 
10074,"ation, WSPF attorneys could proceed in any district in the United "
10075,"States, and the principal witnesses to question and documents to "
10076,"examine were located in Washington. Furthermore, the U.S. Attor- "
10077,neys’ offices were only at early stages in their investigations of many 
10078,of those matters. 
10079,"In the Vesco case, however, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern "
10080,District of New York was preparing for trial of the case by the time 
10081,"WSPF was created. Therefore, after discussions between representa- "
10082,"tives of the two offices, Cox decided to leave direct responsibility for "
10083,the case with the U.S. Attorney. 
10084,"Throughout WSPF’s existence, office attorneys had innumerable "
10085,contacts with other U.S. Attorneys throughout the Nation. Office 
10086,attorneys conducted grand jury hearings in several districts outside 
10087,"Washington, D.C., and each of the U.S. Attorney’s offices cooperated "
10088,"in making the necessary arrangements. On a few occasions, a U.S. "
10089,Attorney would receive information about a possible criminal act 
10090,within the Special Prosecutor’s jurisdiction and WSPF would decide 
10091,"whether to take jurisdiction. In some campaign contribution matters, "
10092,when the contribution allegation was part of a larger investigation 
10093,"already well underway in the U.S. Attorney’s office, the Special "
10094,Prosecutor decided not to bifurcate the investigatory process and told 
10095,the U.S. Attorney to proceed while keeping WSPF informed of prog- 
10096,ress in the matter. 
10097,3 George Hearing’s case was handled by the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Middle 
10098,District of Florida. 
10099,223
10100,"As of August 1975, WSPF investigations had produced eleven in- "
10101,dictments not finally resolved through guilty pleas. Of the eleven trials 
10102,"that were necessary, six were held in Washington, D.C., and the other "
10103,"five were held, or are scheduled to be held as this report is written, in "
10104,"New York City, N.Y. ; San Antonio, Texas; Los Angeles, California; "
10105,"Minneapolis, Minn.; and Chicago, Illinois. In each case, the U.S. "
10106,Attorney extended full cooperation; and in the conviction of Jack 
10107,"Chestnut, a dairy industry contributions matter, the Office of the "
10108,United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York con- 
10109,ducted the trial at WSPF’s request and obtained Chestnut’s 
10110,conviction. 
10111,State Prosecutors 
10112,"At the time WSPF was created, Richard Gerstein, State’s attorney "
10113,"for Dade County, Florida, was inquiring into allegations that the "
10114,Watergate break-in was actually planned in Dade County in violation 
10115,"of State laws; and Joseph P. Busch, District Attorney of Los Angeles "
10116,"County, California, had undertaken an investigation of the Fielding "
10117,"break-in which led to the September 4, 1973, indictment of John "
10118,"Ehrlichman, Egil Krogh, Jr., G. Gordon Liddy, and David R. Young. "
10119,Gerstein began his inquiry into the Watergate break-in not long 
10120,after the FBI began its investigation. He believed that certain actions 
10121,leading to the break-in occurred in Dade County and his office there- 
10122,"fore had jurisdiction over aspects of the case. He acquired records, "
10123,cancelled checks and bank statements from Federal authorities as 
10124,part of his investigation. 
10125,Since the Watergate break-in and the alleged cover-up were the 
10126,"most important responsibilities of WSPF, the Special Prosecutor "
10127,was concerned lest action by Gerstein relating to events in Florida 
10128,might impede the investigation and prosecution of the case as a whole. 
10129,Gerstein made several trips to Washington to confer with attorneys 
10130,"in the Special Prosecutor’s office. In January 1974, as the tapes hear- "
10131,"ings ended and the office neared indictments in the Watergate case, "
10132,the new Special Prosecutor wrote to Gerstein warning him about the 
10133,dangers of any action on the State level. 
10134,"At this late date, any indictment and prosecution in Florida "
10135,touching upon matters now under consideration by the Federal 
10136,grand jury might interfere with potential Federal prosecutions. 
10137,There would be risk of difficulty and confusion in the handling of 
10138,"evidence, and the interrogation of witnesses. Also, there might be "
10139,problems of double jeopardy. 
10140,I fully appreciate your responsibility for investigating and 
10141,"prosecuting violations of Florida law. Nevertheless, because the "
10142,activity on which you are focusing is only a part of the activity 
10143,"under investigation by this office and the Federal grand jury, "
10144,I believe this would be an appropriate case for you to defer to 
10145,224
10146,"Federal jurisdiction,, at least in the first instance. I do not overlook "
10147,"the problems you face under the Florida statute of limitations, "
10148,"but, as I indicated today, the Federal investigation should be "
10149,completed sufficiently in advance of your deadline to allow you to 
10150,take whatever action you deem appropriate after the Federal grand 
10151,"jury concludes its investigation. Accordingly, I renew my request "
10152,that you continue to defer any action until that time. 
10153,The letter and subsequent conversations with the Dade County 
10154,State's attorney resulted in his deferring to the Federal grand jury 
10155,in Washington. 
10156,The Los Angeles County investigation into the break-in at the 
10157,office of Dr. Lewis Fielding began before the appointment of a Special 
10158,Prosecutor. After Los Angeles County indictments were returned on 
10159,"September 4, 1973, the Special Prosecutor issued a statement in which "
10160,he made clear that the “Federal interest” in the Fielding break-in 
10161,predominated: 
10162,"This office has, from its beginning, been investigating the "
10163,"events leading to the break-in at Dr. Fielding's office, both specif- "
10164,ically and as part of a wider inquiry into other possibly illegal 
10165,activities purportedly undertaken in the name of “national 
10166,security.” 
10167,In our view the Federal interest in dealing with any possible 
10168,illegal activities by White House employees is clearly predominant. 
10169,The statement expressed confidence “that ways can be found of 
10170,avoiding conflict and confusion while the Federal investigation and 
10171,prosecution of any resulting indictments go forward.” 
10172,"The California case went forward on its own schedule, and de- "
10173,fendant G. Gordon Liddy was transferred from the D.C. jail to 
10174,California to await trial. When the Federal grand jury in Washington 
10175,"handed up indictments in the case on March 7, 1974, District Attorney "
10176,"Busch came to Washington, met with Jaworski, and agreed to seek "
10177,"court dismissal of the indictments pending against Krogh, Liddy and "
10178,"Young. He wished to retain a perjury charge against Ehrlichman, "
10179,"however, and Jaworski expressed no objection. "
10180,After their meeting Busch and Jaworski issued a joint statement 
10181,announcing the dismissal: 
10182,As a result of these discussions and for reasons assigned by the 
10183,"Special Prosecutor, District Attorney Busch has agreed to seek "
10184,dismissal of the charges of conspiracy and burglary as to David R. 
10185,"Young, John Ehrlichman and G. Gordon Liddy. Among the "
10186,reasons given for seeking to dismiss are that many of these issues 
10187,"involve matters of national interest and, therefore, would best be "
10188,"decided in the Federal court system. Also, the two indictments "
10189,would be exposing defendants to trial in two different jurisdic- 
10190,"tions and, in fairness to those defendants charged in both juris- "
10191,"dictions and in the interest of justice, they should be tried in one "
10192,jurisdiction. The perjury charge as to John Ehrlichman in Los 
10193,Angeles County will remain. It invokes protection solely of a 
10194,State interest. Mr. Jaworski expressed his deep appreciation to 
10195,zzs 
10196,Mr. Busch and his staff for their cooperation in resolving these 
10197,matters. 
10198,The perjury charge was dismissed in Los Angeles after sentencing 
10199,"in United States v. Mitchell, et al., on February 21, 1975. "
10200,******* 
10201,"In addition to the relations described above, WSPF also received "
10202,extensive help from other Federal agencies. Several of the regulatory 
10203,agencies were requested to furnish information related to WSPF 
10204,"investigations of campaign contributions, and office attorneys were "
10205,"permitted access to relevant files. In addition, when WSPF completed "
10206,a case wherein the subject matter was of interest to a regulatory 
10207,"agency, pertinent information was furnished to them. For example, the "
10208,Campaign Contributions Task Force had close liaison with the Securi- 
10209,ties and Exchange Commission which investigated and brought 
10210,subsequent proceedings against many of the corporations which had 
10211,pleaded guilty in WSPF cases. 
10212,"Support assistance in connection with witness security, witness "
10213,transportation and witness availability was received on an intensive 
10214,basis from the Bureau of Prisons and the United States Marshals 
10215,"Service, both agencies within the Department of Justice. The leader- "
10216,ship and personnel of both these agencies were always cooperative 
10217,and helpful to WSPF attorneys. 
10218,"Finally, officers from the Federal Protective Service (part of the "
10219,General Services Administration) served as guards and general 
10220,keepers of the security at WSPF’s offices. Officers were on duty 24 
10221,"hours each day, seven days each week throughout WSPF’s existence. "
10222,The security arrangements were under the supervision of Winslow 
10223,Joy of the Department of Justice.* They maintained the security 
10224,without flaw. 
10225,226
10226,Appendix G: 
10227,Press Relations 
10228,"By the time of Archibald Cox's appointment as Special Prosecutor, "
10229,“Watergate” had become the major journalistic event in the Nation. 
10230,"The Senate Select Committee hearings, which had begun a week "
10231,"earlier, were covered live daily by the major networks, enabling "
10232,millions of Americans to witness the unfolding of the scandal. 
10233,Inspired or embarrassed by the persistent investigative reports of the 
10234,"Washington Post , many reporters assigned to cover the affair scrambled "
10235,frantically in the competition to discover and reveal new examples of 
10236,executive branch misdeeds. Although Cox realized that his obligations 
10237,as a prosecutor would necessarily require that he conduct his work in 
10238,utmost confidentiality and that there would be little he could say to 
10239,"the press, he decided early in his tenure to establish a public affairs "
10240,office to handle what was certain to be a massive volume of inquiries 
10241,from the press and the public. 
10242,Cox was mindful of the national concern over Watergate and of 
10243,the public's right to be kept as fully informed as possible about the 
10244,work of his office. “The public deserves as much accurate information 
10245,as is consistent with the sometimes severe constraints placed on 
10246,"prosecutors as officers of the court,” he said when he announced the "
10247,establishment of the Public Affairs Office. In addition to observing 
10248,"these constraints, it was important to demonstrate the professional "
10249,competence and integrity of the office by maintaining the con- 
10250,fidentiality of information received in office interviews and grand 
10251,jury appearances. It was also important to instill confidence on the 
10252,part of potential witnesses that their dealings with the office would 
10253,not be subjected to unwarranted or premature public disclosure. 
10254,"At the time, a number of news stories had appeared — attributed "
10255,to sources in both the legislative and executive branches — which 
10256,purported to detail allegations against various figures linked to 
10257,Watergate. Cox was determined that his office would have no part in 
10258,adding to speculation concerning his work. His initial success in this 
10259,"endeavor was described by the New York Times , which reported on "
10260,May 31: 
10261,.An imposed silence fell over the Watergate criminal investi- 
10262,"gation today as Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor, and his "
10263,staff began reviewing the case. 
10264,227
10265,Mr. Cox seemed to be clearly in charge. His order to refrain 
10266,"from any kind of statement, comment or speculation about any "
10267,aspect of the investigation was being followed by usually talkative 
10268,sources in the Justice Department. 
10269,"In a memorandum to the staff dated August 15, Cox formalized "
10270,the office policy concerning press relations. “Aside from the normal 
10271,"restraints on a prosecutor, we have the added problems of the explosive "
10272,"nature of the matters we deal with, and the extra competitive strain "
10273,"on many of the reporters who cover us,” the memorandum noted. "
10274,"No one other than Cox, his task force heads and members of the "
10275,"senior staff were expected to talk to reporters, and then only rarely. "
10276,No attorney had permission to submit to an interview without 
10277,"clearance from the public information officer. As a general rule, only "
10278,the Special Prosecutor or his official spokesman was expected to 
10279,represent office policy to the press. 1 
10280,The public information office decided at the outset that it would 
10281,attempt to handle press inquiries and press problems on an individual 
10282,"basis whenever possible, avoiding general press briefings and press "
10283,releases. This meant that the number of telephone inquiries each day 
10284,"multiplied, but most of the 45 reporters who covered the office at "
10285,the height of public interest approved of a system in which they were 
10286,"handled separately, even if it meant waiting several hours in some "
10287,cases before their inquiries were answered. The number of daily tele- 
10288,phone calls sometimes ran to more than 200. A major effort was made 
10289,in the early weeks to convince reporters that the office intended to 
10290,"be “leakproof” and most reporters approved of this policy, providing "
10291,"it was adhered to. Partly because of severe space problems, there "
10292,was no press room at 1425 K Street. Newsmen were discouraged from 
10293,"coming to the offices without an appointment, and only on rare "
10294,occasions was a camera crew stakeout rewarded with an interview 
10295,by either a staff member or a visitor to the office. Often extra effort 
10296,was made to avoid such interviews by having individuals leave the 
10297,building through a side exit. 
10298,The basic guidelines for the Special Prosecutor’s relations with 
10299,"the press were judicial orders, regulations, and professional standards "
10300,"adopted by the U.S. District Court, the Department of Justice, and "
10301,"the American Bar Association. Once indictments were returned, the "
10302,attorneys and the public information office usually chose to err on 
10303,"1 “We have made it a general rule,” the August 15 memorandum noted, "
10304,“that we do not wish to have information disseminated as from a ‘source close 
10305,to the prosecution’ or any similar euphemism which makes it clear that it comes 
10306,from this office but that it is given anonymously. This device is sometimes used 
10307,by diplomats and others who wish to disseminate information but avoid the 
10308,embarrassment of admitting that they are the source. We are not in such 
10309,a position.” 
10310,228
10311,the side of caution and say nothing that could be construed as an 
10312,extrajudicial statement concerning a pending case. 
10313,"On the other hand, to give the public as much information as "
10314,possible about the Special Prosecutor’s office in the early stages of 
10315,"their work, both Special Prosecutors Cox and Jaworski made them- "
10316,selves available to reporters at occasional news conferences and in 
10317,formal interviews in their offices or at television studios. A number 
10318,of less formal visits were arranged with individual newsmen or news 
10319,organizations as a means of accommodating the intense media interest 
10320,"in the work of the office. In each case, it was understood in advance "
10321,that no confidential material would be disclosed. 
10322,The secrecy with which the Special Prosecutor’s office operated 
10323,appeared to the press at times excessive. Some members of the press 
10324,were especially dissatisfied with what seemed to be excessive secrecy 
10325,surrounding court proceedings in which WSPF was involved — the 
10326,"sealing of court documents, lack of detail in court papers and failure "
10327,to disclose fully what alleged offenses were disposed of through 
10328,"negotiated guilty pleas. More generally, the notoriety of the cases "
10329,"brought by the office, the massive press and public interest in the "
10330,"outcome of the office’s investigations, the amount of evidentiary "
10331,material laid out on the public record by the Senate Select Com- 
10332,"mittee and others, and the President’s possible personal involvement "
10333,created intense pressure to find out what was going on behind the 
10334,heavily guarded entrance to the Special Prosecutor’s office. This 
10335,pressure worried prosecutors who were not used to operating under 
10336,such intense public scrutiny and who were concerned that massive 
10337,publicity could jeopardize the cases they had laboriously and care- 
10338,fully investigated. 
10339,Many reporters covering the office felt that the “legal considera- 
10340,tions” advanced for secrecy did not justify denying them information 
10341,to which they felt entitled. As one reporter put it : 
10342,I think your office has put together one of the best bands of 
10343,"lawyers this town has ever known, but they are still government "
10344,lawyers and they think like government lawyers. And government 
10345,"lawyers, and other Washington lawyers, got us into this mess in "
10346,"the first place. So I think in this area of cases above all, we need "
10347,to know more about the way government lawyers think and why 
10348,they decide to do things and not to do things. Lawyers don’t 
10349,like to talk about those things and over the years they have 
10350,developed all sorts of fancy reasons not to. And since congressmen 
10351,(mostly) and judges (entirely) — the only ones with subpoena 
10352,"powers — are lawyers too, nobody can make them. But I think "
10353,you ought to be prepared to explain your decisions. And if you’re 
10354,"not, you ought to be prepared to explain why you’re not. "
10355,Most Government agencies (like other organizations) are affected 
10356,"by leaks, which usually result from attempts by individuals within "
10357,the agency to explain or defend their actions or to ingratiate them- 
10358,"selves with journalists, and from good detective work by newsmen. "
10359,The Watergate Special Prosecution Force had two particular concerns 
10360,about leaks: that they would create prejudicial publicity which 
10361,"might jeopardize investigations and prosecutions, and that they "
10362,would reflect poorly on the professionalism and the impartiality of 
10363,the staff. 
10364,"Fortunately, WSPF experienced very few suspected leaks. In "
10365,"August 1973, it was discovered that some information discarded as "
10366,trash had made its way to the Washington Post. A shredder was pur- 
10367,chased to prevent any such experience in the future. In three other 
10368,"situations (one in the summer of 1973, one in early 1974, and the last "
10369,"in early 1975), stories appeared which some thought might have origi- "
10370,"nated at least indirectly from WSPF staff members. As a result, in an "
10371,"attempt to ascertain the source of the stories, the Special Prosecutor "
10372,directed that all employees who had access to the information sign 
10373,affidavits as to any discussions they may have had with reporters. No 
10374,improprieties were discovered. 
10375,"Apart from dealing with representatives of the news media, the "
10376,public information office handled relations with its counterparts at 
10377,the Department of Justice and the White House. Relations with the 
10378,Justice Department’s Office of Public Information (PIO) were kept 
10379,friendly but distant in order to emphasize WSPF’s independence. 
10380,While the offices frequently consulted on press inquiries of mutual 
10381,"concern, neither attempted to go beyond this level. Justice PIO did "
10382,not supervise the prosecution force PIO and neither discussed with 
10383,the other any dealings which the Special Prosecutor might be having 
10384,with the Attorney General or other departmental officials. 
10385,Relations with the White House press office were almost non- 
10386,existent during the Nixon Administration. Some members of the 
10387,White House staff who had frequent dealings with the press often 
10388,"attacked the prosecution staff, usually on a background basis not "
10389,directly attributable to the quoted party. WSPF responded to re- 
10390,"porters regarding these criticisms, but rarely contacted White House "
10391,"staff members. In one instance, however, Special Prosecutor Jaworski "
10392,wrote to White House press secretary Ronald Ziegler to refute Ziegler’s 
10393,public inference that the WSPF staff was acting from politically 
10394,partisan motives. 
10395,Relations with the White House press office during the Ford 
10396,Administration were friendly but infrequent. 
10397,230
10398,Appendix H: 
10399,Information Section 
10400,WSPF created an Information Section to provide a computerized 
10401,information retrieval system from a data base consisting of sworn 
10402,"testimony, office interviews and documentary evidence. In addition "
10403,"to its computer-based functions, the Information Section served as "
10404,a centralized paralegal staff used for individual projects in each of 
10405,WSPF’s task forces. 
10406,EARLY HISTORY 
10407,One of the major problems facing WSPF attorneys in the summer 
10408,of 1973 was assimilating the enormous — and increasing — volume of 
10409,information available both on the public record and in private 
10410,documents concerning the subject matter of many of the office’s 
10411,"investigations. Special Prosecutor Cox, aware that the flow of informa- "
10412,tion into the office was too great to be collated and analyzed by his 
10413,"prosecutors, established an Information Section to pull together the "
10414,material already available and to prepare for an even greater volume 
10415,of testimony and documentary information as the staff and the scope 
10416,of investigations expanded. 
10417,Lawyers' Summaries 
10418,"In late June 1973, the Information Section consisted of ten recent "
10419,"law school graduates who manually summarized grand jury, civil, and "
10420,"Congressional testimony. They worked 60 to 70 hours a week, con- "
10421,centrating on testimony given before the Senate Select Committee 
10422,on Presidential Campaign Activities (SSC). The changing requirements 
10423,of WSPF task forces often shifted the information needs from one 
10424,"witness or event to another, and thus aggravated the difficulties "
10425,caused by the heavy volume of testimony. By late July the young 
10426,"lawyers, who had been told that this would be a temporary assignment "
10427,and who had become dissatisfied with the tedium and the changing 
10428,"demands put upon them, were reassigned to task forces and to the "
10429,Counsel’s staff. 
10430,231
10431,Planning lor Computerization 
10432,"While the summarizing project was still in process, Harry Bratt, "
10433,"an administrator with previous experience in computer sytems, had "
10434,been detailed from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration 
10435,to study the possibility of establishing a computer operation to handle 
10436,the volume of information. Assisted by a research anatyst with para- 
10437,"legal experience and a lawyer with computer expertise, Bratt began "
10438,"evaluating computer systems, particularly the testimony abstraction "
10439,system used by the Senate Select Committee. 
10440,It was evident that WSPF would encounter certain problems in 
10441,undertaking a computerized information retrieval system — the need 
10442,"for security, the shifting nature of prosecutors’ information require- "
10443,"ments, attorneys’ traditional maintenance of files and records accord- "
10444,"ing to their individual styles, and lack of use or trust by attorneys "
10445,as to computer operations. Bratt recommended undertaking such an 
10446,operation only if arrangements could be made for a joint effort with 
10447,the Select Committee. 
10448,The SSC staff agreed to show WSPF all aspects of the Committee’s 
10449,computer operation and to assist in developing a system for the 
10450,"Prosecution Force. WSPF and SSC staffs also agreed, subject to the "
10451,"Committee’s approval, that if WSPF decided to undertake computer- "
10452,ization they would provide to each other all computer records their 
10453,staffs prepared from publicly available material . 1 
10454,"The Library of Congress, which developed and maintained the "
10455,"SSC’s computer system, agreed to provide a similar service for WSPF "
10456,"on a cost reimbursable basis, after obtaining approval to engage in a "
10457,non-Congressional project. The Library’s facilities provided the ad- 
10458,vantages of a high level of security and rapid start-up time gained 
10459,"from utilizing the SSC’s already operational system. On this basis, "
10460,Cox approved undertaking a computer operation similar to the Select 
10461,"Committee’s, and Bratt was formally hired to head the operation. "
10462,1 The Committee subsequently approved this agreement and allowed WSPF 
10463,to copy the computer tape containing its records prepared from the Committee's 
10464,public hearings. As additional public materials — press clippings and other public 
10465,"testimony — were computerized, the Committee provided updated tapes. Later, "
10466,the Committee gave WSPF a copy of the computer tape of its records prepared 
10467,"from non-public materials — its staff interviews, its Executive Session hearings, "
10468,and some telephone records and diaries which the Committee had acquired. 
10469,"Subsequently, much of this non-public material was made public in the SSC's "
10470,"final report. WSPF eventually computerized several diaries and, since the Com- "
10471,"mittee also had acquired copies of them, provided a computer tape of the records "
10472,prepared from the diaries to the Committee. All other material computerized 
10473,by WSPF was prepared from non-public materials which the Committee did not 
10474,already have and hence was not provided to the Committee. 
10475,232
10476,Organisation of WSPF's Computer System 
10477,"After some staff discussion and disagreements, Cox decided that "
10478,grand jury testimony and WSPF and FBI interviews would be given 
10479,"computer input priority over the diaries, logs and other documentary "
10480,"evidence available from witnesses. By August 27, a list of the most "
10481,important witnesses had been prepared with highest priorities reserved 
10482,"for testimony and statements concerning the Fielding break-in, the "
10483,"break-in of DNC headquarters at the Watergate Office Building, and "
10484,the efforts to conceal the connection between those who performed 
10485,these break-ins and White House and CRP officials. 
10486,"A computer input format, similar to that used by the Select Com- "
10487,"mittee, was developed. It contained the following fields 2 : "
10488,1. Record number. 
10489,2. Name of witness; date of testimony or interview; and a com- 
10490,puter sort number based on date of testimony or interview. 
10491,"3. Forum (grand jury, WSPF interview, or FBI interview); and "
10492,page(s) of transcript or interview write-up on which the wit- 
10493,ness’ testimony or statements about an event were located. 
10494,4. Summary of testimony or statements about an event; and 
10495,name of person who summarized it. 
10496,5. Comment; name of commentator; and date of comment (this 
10497,allowed the summarizer or anyone else to point out conflicts 
10498,"between different accounts of the same event, to note informa- "
10499,tion such as the date of the event or persons involved in it 
10500,"when the witness did not explicitly state them, and so forth). "
10501,6. Name of person involved in the event; date of event; and a 
10502,sort number based on date of event (there would be an entry 
10503,in this field for each person involved in the event) . 
10504,7. Subject code (as many entries in this field as broad subjects 
10505,"to which the event related — Watergate, campaign contributions, "
10506,etc.). 
10507,This input format allowed retrieval of information from the 
10508,computer data base in the following ways : 
10509,1. Records of statements by a certain witness. 
10510,2. Records about events relating to a certain person. 
10511,3. Records about events relating to a certain topic. 
10512,4. Records about events in which statements were attributed to a 
10513,certain person. 
10514,5. Records containing any key word or phrase or combination of 
10515,key words or phrases. 
10516,2 A “field” is a length of characters which always represents the same type of 
10517,"information, e.g., the computer date field “750416” has a length of six characters "
10518,"and always represents the date by year (2 characters), month (2 characters), and "
10519,"day (2 characters). The information in the field may change from record to record, "
10520,but this particular field always represents the date. 
10521,233
10522,591-439 0 - 75-16 
10523,"Other retrievals and combinations of retrievals were possible, and "
10524,all of the records retrieved could be sorted to print in chronological 
10525,order. 
10526,WSPF contracted with the Library of Congress for systems 
10527,"analysis and processing, and the Library agreed to provide the "
10528,"services of a senior systems analyst, programmers, and operations "
10529,personnel on a cost-reimbursable basis. 3 Two evenings each week 
10530,were reserved for processing WSPF's data files. To accommodate 
10531,"security requirements, the Library scheduled these computer runs "
10532,"between midnight and 8 a.m., when all on-line (teleprocessing) "
10533,"terminals to the computers were shut off, and arranged that no other "
10534,processing would be performed while WSPF data were being processed. 
10535,"As a further precaution, it was agreed that only the computer operator "
10536,and a representative of WSPF would be allowed in the computer 
10537,room during the computer runs. The Library also permitted WSPF 
10538,"to install a safe, to which only WSPF staff had the combination, "
10539,"in a vault at the Library for storage of tapes, disc packs, and print "
10540,"ribbons. All printouts, carbons, and key punch cards were to be "
10541,taken back to the WSPF office after each computer run. 
10542,In mid-August the Select Committee's information staff provided 
10543,a two-week training course for the first four research analysts hired 
10544,and in early September they began preparing input records. Input 
10545,records were typed on key-to-tape machines. The tapes were later 
10546,converted to computer readable form. 
10547,"For its own operation, WSPF’s Information Section decided to "
10548,make several changes in the SSC's input procedures. WSPF assigned 
10549,a research analyst all of a witness' testimony and other statements 
10550,to abstract — rather than splitting transcripts and shifting assignments 
10551,"to meet immediate priorities as the Committee’s staff did. Also, WSPF "
10552,required abstraction of testimony in much greater detail than did the 
10553,Select Committee. The Information Section felt that it should not 
10554,judge what was or was not important in a witness’ response to a 
10555,"question, knowing that frequently a point made by a witness or a "
10556,vague remark which seems insignificant in one context could be very 
10557,significant in another context or to another questioner. 
10558,The Information Section also decided to institute a quality control 
10559,check for all records prepared for computer input. Few if any of the 
10560,prosecutors hired by WSPF had worked with a paralegal staff or had 
10561,"used computerized methods, and therefore the accuracy of the data "
10562,was critical to the section's ability to convince the prosecutors of the 
10563,usefulness of computer services. Senior research analysts reviewed all 
10564,records against the transcripts. 
10565,"3 The computer contract with the Library cost $100,000 over a two-year "
10566,period. This figure excludes Information Section salary and expense costs. 
10567,234
10568,The Select Committee's input procedures allowed very quick 
10569,"“turnaround time"" — the time between receiving transcripts to ab- "
10570,stract and having records in the computer — and the Committee staff 
10571,used printouts of statements by a witness and of references to him for 
10572,questioning that witness in public session hearings. Under the pro- 
10573,"cedures adopted by the Information Section, particularly the detail "
10574,"and quality control requirements, the turnaround time was consider- "
10575,ably lengthened. 
10576,In the fall of 1973 additional staff was hired for the Information 
10577,"Section. Eventually a staff of two reviewers, six research analysts "
10578,and two typists seemed to provide a balanced flow of work for tes- 
10579,"timony abstraction. By mid-winter, with the added staff and the reso- "
10580,"lution of procedural questions, the Section could prepare "
10581,approximately 900 records for computer input each month. 4 
10582,ACTIVITIES OF THE INFORMATION SECTION 
10583,Computerization of Testimony and Other Witness Statements 
10584,For its first project the Information Section abstracted and 
10585,computerized testimony and other statements of people with knowl- 
10586,edge of the Fielding break-in or the Watergate cover-up. The section 
10587,developed a goal of completing this project in time to aid the Plumbers 
10588,and Watergate Task Forces in their preparation for indictments and 
10589,"trial. In fact, completion could not be accomplished until after the "
10590,"indictments had occurred, but well before the trial dates. "
10591,"By May 1974 virtually all relevant grand jury testimony, office "
10592,"interviews, and other statements by defendants and major witnesses "
10593,in the Fielding break-in case had been abstracted and entered in the 
10594,"computer. By late May, the project produced chronological printouts "
10595,of all statements by each defendant and major witness and cross- 
10596,reference printouts of what each of these people had said about the 
10597,others. A lawyer from the trial team prepared a list of significant 
10598,"events to be proved at the trial, and the research analysts determined "
10599,the various accounts of these events by each witness and defendant 
10600,"and noted any discrepancies therein. The chronological printouts, "
10601,"cross-reference printouts, and analyses were provided to the trial "
10602,team as aids in reviewing with witnesses what they would be ques- 
10603,tioned about at the trial and in evaluating the defendants' expected 
10604,"4 Roughly, 150 pages of testimony produced 100 records. Under WSPPs input "
10605,"procedures, each research analyst could abstract approximately 225 pages of "
10606,testimony per month. The number of records produced from the interview write- 
10607,"ups varied greatly, depending on the style of the writer. The actual number of "
10608,records entered in the computer per month varied throughout the period of this 
10609,project because of frequent temporary transfer of analysts to other projects. 
10610,235
10611,"defenses. In addition, during the United States v. Ehrlichman trial, "
10612,special reports were run at the request of the trial team to review 
10613,prior testimony by and about defense witnesses as a basis for antici- 
10614,pating their trial testimony and planning their cross-examination. 
10615,By the summer of 1974 the Section had completed computerizing 
10616,relevant testimony and other statements by the defendants in the 
10617,Watergate cover-up case and most of the testimony and other state- 
10618,ments by the witnesses deemed by the Watergate task force to be 
10619,computer priorities. These records were merged with records from 
10620,the Select Committee’s data base. Chronological printouts of state- 
10621,ments by each defendant and each witness were not analyzed by the 
10622,"analysts as had been done for the Fielding case, but were given "
10623,directly to the lawyers of the trial team as aids in preparing for 
10624,trial. 
10625,Also in the summer of 1974 the section began computerizing 
10626,testimony and other statements of several witnesses in a Campaign 
10627,Contributions Task Force investigation. This was abandoned later 
10628,because of the then pressing demands of the Watergate cover-up 
10629,trial. 
10630,"On the whole, computerizing testimony and other witness state- "
10631,ments proved far more time-consuming and was far less used in the 
10632,Watergate case than had been anticipated. Usage in the Fielding 
10633,break-in case and in other investigations was much greater. Certain 
10634,attorneys and their investigations were more amenable to use of the 
10635,computerized data than were others. These attorneys developed com- 
10636,binations of name references and key word queries to retrieve man- 
10637,ageable and valuable information from the data base. This technique 
10638,generally exploited the more lengthy SSC data base and was used to 
10639,great advantage in later work with diary entries and telephone records. 
10640,"The name or word search, typically at the beginning of an investiga- "
10641,"tion, provided a fairly comprehensive picture of the SSC’s prior "
10642,investigation. 
10643,Documentary Evidence 
10644,1. Diaries and Appointment Logs. In February 1974 the Informa- 
10645,tion Section began computerizing several diaries and appointment logs 
10646,which had been acquired by the Campaign Contributions Task Force. 
10647,The analysts adoped an input format virtually identical to that used 
10648,for abstracting transcripts and created a subject code which would 
10649,allow these records to be retrieved from the computer either in con- 
10650,junction with testimonial records or as a separate data base. Diary 
10651,"and log entries were recorded exactly as stated, rather than sum- "
10652,"marized, except that abbreviations and short notations were clarified. "
10653,Diary records were much quicker to abstract and consequently 
10654,"typing became very backlogged. Approximately 12,000 diary records "
10655,236
10656,were transcribed in three months and typing was completed about 
10657,"three months later. 5 Because of the unforeseen typing lag, computer- "
10658,izing each entry in these diaries took much longer to complete than 
10659,expected. The computer offered cross reference and selective retrieval 
10660,"capacities, both of which proved valuable because the wealth of "
10661,material pertinent to several investigations could not otherwise be 
10662,assimilated. Manual searches by several different investigation teams 
10663,would have been very time consuming and not as reliable. 
10664,"This system proved invaluable, for example, with a cooperating "
10665,witness who had furnished various of his diaries that showed his 
10666,contacts with potential campaign contributors over a four-year period. 
10667,The abstractors became adept at reading the diarist’s handwriting 
10668,and abbreviations. Cross reference provided a method of checking 
10669,whether and when an individual or corporation was mentioned. 
10670,Selective retrieval was used to pull all records referring to any of a list 
10671,of individuals or subjects (keywords). This enabled investigators to 
10672,pull selectively where contacts were very frequent but on varied 
10673,topics. 
10674,Lawyers used the computer reports to prepare their questions for 
10675,interviews of the diarist about his contacts with contributors and for 
10676,questioning other key people involved in campaign and fund raising. 
10677,"In addition, diary abstracts were also used for questioning the included "
10678,persons about contacts they had had with the diarist. The entries 
10679,conveyed much about the diarist’s styles of operation. Computer 
10680,input of the diaries was substantially complete and ready for the 
10681,comprehensive interviews of the witness in early summer 1974. 
10682,Printouts were supplemented by manual searches of the untyped 
10683,"abstracts. In addition to the cross-reference reports, printouts inter- "
10684,filing all references to any of a list of persons mentioned or key words 
10685,contained in the diary proved valuable in several investigations. 
10686,2. Telephone Toll Records. A telephone toll record project began 
10687,in spring 1974 with the receipt of the SSC’s computer file based on 
10688,telephone records the SSC had received in connection with their 
10689,investigation of a matter also under inquiry by WSPF. In order to 
10690,make the SSC file usable the Information Section and the Library of 
10691,Congress developed a program to match a list of subscribers’ names 
10692,compiled by the SSC to the appropriate called or calling numbers. 
10693,"When this step had been accomplished in fall 1974, the attorney in "
10694,charge of the investigation requested that telephone bills subpoenaed 
10695,by WSPF from persons under investigation and an IRS computer 
10696,5 The relationship of analyst effort to typist effort is difficult to appraise. 
10697,"Of the four analysts who worked on the project, two had continuing transcript "
10698,assignments and two had competing responsibilities. Transcript records con- 
10699,stituted roughly one-third of the typing during the spring and summer. The best 
10700,estimate of allotment of work for the diary project is 2J4 analysts to % reviewer 
10701,to four typists. 
10702,237
10703,file of related telephone records be merged with the Senate file. The 
10704,IRS data and the new input of records were also checked against the 
10705,"subscribers’ list; and subscriber names, if identified, were added to the "
10706,records. In the course of the investigation this process was repeated 
10707,several times as the table of known parties called was expanded. 
10708,Comprehensive chronological printouts and printouts showing all 
10709,calls to each number were then obtained. The printout reflected the 
10710,"date of the telephone call, the name of the subscriber of the calling "
10711,"number, the number called, the name of the subscriber of the number "
10712,"called, if known, and the cost and time of the call when that informa- "
10713,tion appeared on the bill. These printouts were used by the research 
10714,analyst assisting in the investigation to study patterns of contact 
10715,among the persons being investigated. This information was then 
10716,used to issue subpoenas to telephone companies to learn selected 
10717,called subscribers’ names. Analysis of this information provided 
10718,valuable leads for questioning witnesses and for tracking the activities 
10719,of persons under investigation. 
10720,3. Indexing . A computer indexing project was undertaken in a 
10721,"major investigation to organize a substantial body of correspondence, "
10722,"memoranda, and other personal papers of witnesses and defendants. "
10723,"The writer (s), receiver (s), date and substance of all important docu- "
10724,"ments — letters, memoranda, notes, etc. — obtained in the investigation "
10725,were indexed and entered in the computer in the following format: 
10726,1. Author; date of document; computer sort number based on 
10727,date of document. 
10728,2. Type of document; number of pages. 
10729,3. Addressee. 
10730,4. Brief synopsis. 
10731,"5. Names of persons who drafted, approved, or in any other way "
10732,"helped prepare or were connected with the document, including "
10733,persons who received copies (if such information was reflected 
10734,on the document). 
10735,6. Comments (such as whose copy WSPF had obtained). 
10736,"7. All persons mentioned, including author, addressee and persons "
10737,mentioned in the synopsis (separate entry for each person) . 
10738,Category 7 and the computer sort number were used to arrange 
10739,"the information in categories 1-6 in cross-reference reports, thus or- "
10740,ganizing all documentary references to each person in chronological 
10741,order. This retrieval capability proved so satisfactory that a second 
10742,stage was undertaken: information culled from other documentary 
10743,"sources — diaries, telephone bills, business records of time spent on "
10744,"work for clients, etc. — was added to the computer data base in a "
10745,compatible format so that it could be retrieved in conjunction with 
10746,the initial input of records. 
10747,"Final cross-reference reports which reflected, for each defendant "
10748,"and witness, all relevant documents he had written, received, been "
10749,"connected with, or been mentioned in, all relevant telephone contacts "
10750,238
10751,"and meetings he had had, and all relevant actions he had taken, were "
10752,then obtained and provided to the lawyers to use in preparation for 
10753,trial. One of the significant factors in the success of this project was 
10754,that the investigators analyzed the importance of documents and other 
10755,facts before computer input was undertaken. This speeded the input 
10756,time and minimized the number of irrelevant records on the printouts. 
10757,"Generally, computer projects involving documentary evidence "
10758,proved far more valuable to the prosecutors than earlier projects 
10759,oriented to testimony. Each was undertaken at the specific request of 
10760,"the lawyer or lawyers who desired to use the output, with the lawyers "
10761,indicating exactly what information was desired. Each resulted in 
10762,comprehensive ordering of information in ways which would have 
10763,been virtually impossible under a manual system. 
10764,General Reference Reports 
10765,In addition to the computer projects undertaken to aid in specific 
10766,"investigations and trials, the computer was used to provide several "
10767,"general reference reports for WSPF. One, called the “Name List,” was "
10768,an alphabetical listing of all persons whose names had been mentioned 
10769,"in the investigations. Each was identified by his or her position or title, "
10770,"and the dates when it was held, if known, or by the activity for which "
10771,"his or her name had been mentioned. Another, called the “Manage- "
10772,"ment Report,” was a master listing of civil, congressional, grand jury, "
10773,"trial, and other testimony transcripts, and congressional, WSPF, FBI, "
10774,IRS and other interview write-ups. The Management Report pro- 
10775,vided a chronological listing of each witnesses’ testimony and inter- 
10776,"views, the date, number of pages, and subject matter of the testimony "
10777,"or interview, whether the transcript or interview write-up was avail- "
10778,"able in the Central Files, and whether it had been computerized. "
10779,The Information Section also maintained cross-reference printouts 
10780,of its and the Senate Select Committee’s data bases of testimony and 
10781,"other statements as master reference volumes. These reflected, for "
10782,"each person mentioned in the entire data base, all records prepared "
10783,from statements by or about the person in chronological order of the 
10784,events described. The cross-reference reports from the Select Com- 
10785,"mittee’s data base, which was much larger than WSPF’s, were par- "
10786,ticularly useful for a quick check of a person’s involvement in matters 
10787,under investigation. These were used for many purposes by many 
10788,members of the staff. 
10789,The cross-reference reports were also used after November 1974 
10790,as a basis for responding to White House requests about persons being 
10791,considered for appointment to high Administration positions. 
10792,"All types of reference works, but particularly the master cross- "
10793,references and the management report saved a great deal of manual 
10794,file searching. The management report’s inventory of the central files 
10795,239
10796,provided a good start for compiling discovery material for trial. The 
10797,availability of printed cross-reference reports enabled the Information 
10798,Section to respond quickly to name check requests. 
10799,Appeals 
10800,"As of this writing, two further computer projects are under way, "
10801,both to aid in preparation of the brief for the appeal of the Watergate 
10802,"cover-up case: an index of legal papers filed in the case, by topic; and "
10803,"an index of the trial testimony, by events testified to. "
10804,OTHER DUTIES 
10805,"In addition to the computer projects, the analysts in the Informa- "
10806,tion Section worked on several other projects temporarily assigned to 
10807,them on an as-needed basis from the summer of 1973 through Septem- 
10808,ber 1975. Task force requests for this additional assistance were evalu- 
10809,ated by the section heads and approved by the Deputy Special Prose- 
10810,cutor. Analysts were assigned according to the priority and immediacy 
10811,of the task force project as it related to the demands for the various 
10812,computerized record projects. 
10813,Many of these additional assignments related to Presidential tapes 
10814,secured from the White House. Information System analysts provided 
10815,attorneys with daily summaries of the tapes hearings held before Judge 
10816,Sirica in November and December 1973 and January 1974. In August 
10817,"1974, the Special Prosecutor received tape recordings of 64 Watergate- "
10818,related conversations with President Nixon. The entire research 
10819,"staff, with assistance from others in the office, was assigned to verify "
10820,the FBI transcriptions of these recordings. Information Section staff 
10821,subsequently transcribed a number of tapes received in Spring 1975. 
10822,The Information Section also assumed a variety of other duties. 
10823,"Analysts played a major part in the identification, collection and "
10824,"organization of papers and documents to be given to defendants, as "
10825,required by the relevant rules of criminal procedure in the Federal 
10826,system. Additional tasks included providing daily summaries of the 
10827,"Watergate and Connally trial testimony, checking briefs for accuracy, "
10828,and organizing the central and task force files. 
10829,SUMMARY OBSERVATIONS 
10830,WSPF commenced its operations when others had already gathered 
10831,much information about some of the matters assigned to the Special 
10832,Prosecutor. The prosecutors began to organize this information im- 
10833,"mediately, and could not await the careful planning and development "
10834,of a computerized information system. In some cases service of the 
10835,240
10836,lawyers through the research analysts' work product lagged behind 
10837,investigative needs. Because of the hurried start-up of the information 
10838,"system, it is difficult to evaluate the potential future utility of com- "
10839,puterizing grand jury and office interview testimony during the course 
10840,"of an investigation. However, even in WSPF's system, the testimony "
10841,"abstracts and computer runs by various names, dates and subject "
10842,matters proved useful as a double check and as a basis for preparation 
10843,of cross-examination of some trial witnesses for the defense. 
10844,"The other computer applications proved much more useful, pri- "
10845,marily in the investigative process. The computerized telephone 
10846,"records, diaries and appointment logs did not merely replace manual "
10847,efforts; they produced reports which could not have been produced 
10848,manually because of the great volume of material and the level of 
10849,detailed analysis which was required. The manipulation of data made 
10850,possible by the computerized entries served as a valuable investiga- 
10851,tive tool. Also useful in various ways was the general reference material 
10852,which could be retrieved in the different modes required by the 
10853,prosecutors. 
10854,Although WSPF's retrieval system and some of its applications 
10855,"had been developed for the SSC by the Library of Congress, much "
10856,of the work done in the Information Section was experimental. While 
10857,"computerized information retrieval has been used for legal research, "
10858,it had not been used very often for criminal investigations and trials. 
10859,Much more needs to be done by the ongoing prosecutorial agencies to 
10860,develop systems and applications which can be planned and evaluated 
10861,"over time, with careful implementation of the resulting methodological "
10862,changes in order to build maximum use by prosecutors and a proper 
10863,measure of cost effectiveness. 
10864,"The hiring and use of research analysts, who were all recent "
10865,"college graduates, proved invaluable in many of the paralegal tasks "
10866,"presented by investigations and trials. Again, long-range planning "
10867,and evaluation is needed to gauge the best kind of preparatory training 
10868,! for such tasks and the proper education level needed by the personnel 
10869,in order to maintain an effective operation but at the same time not 
10870,involve persons having an education level beyond that which is 
10871,"necessary. In addition, lawyers will need training in computer usages "
10872,and in effective use of paralegal support personnel. 
10873,2 « 
10874,Appendix I: 
10875,Administration 
10876,Organizations — whether governmental or private — depend in 
10877,large part for their success on the work of employees who receive 
10878,"little or no public recognition of their efforts. In this respect, WSPF "
10879,was no exception: the most visible members of the staff were the 
10880,attorneys who conducted the investigations and appeared in court. 
10881,Their work could not have proceeded as smoothly and effectively 
10882,"as it did, however, without the assistance of administrative personnel "
10883,who provided the necessary support. WSPF's Administrative Office 
10884,was responsible for handling the numerous day-to-day questions about 
10885,"personnel matters, budget, physical facilities and equipment, and "
10886,office security. Although WSPF was established as an independent 
10887,"entity within the Justice Department, with full authority to hire its "
10888,"own staff, it attempted to conform its administrative practices to "
10889,Department policies and guidelines. To avoid unwarranted depar- 
10890,"tures from Department practices, WSPF's Administrative Officer "
10891,reported directly to the Special Prosecutor and consulted with the 
10892,Department's Office of Management and Budget. 
10893,"1. Personnel . During its formative stages, the task of interviewing "
10894,and hiring staff members was handled by several attorneys chosen 
10895,by Special Prosecutor Cox to assist him in setting up the office. 
10896,"Thereafter, the primary responsibility for these activities fell to the "
10897,"Administrative Office, which hired clerical and support personnel "
10898,and assisted in the selection of additional attorneys. In addition the 
10899,Administrative Office was responsible for the preparation of position 
10900,descriptions; determination of grade levels; the handling of all 
10901,"personnel requests such as appointments, reassignments, promotions "
10902,and resignations; and advising and assisting the various task forces 
10903,"regarding such matters as personnel management, employee relations, "
10904,performance evaluations and awards. The magnitude of this task was 
10905,amplified by the fluctuation of personnel among task forces and in 
10906,and out of WSPF. 
10907,The Administrative Office also established a work program with 
10908,"the Model Secondary School for the Deaf, the high school located at "
10909,"Gallaudet College in Washington. During the school year, ten deaf "
10910,students worked in the Administrative Office. They were responsible 
10911,242
10912,for the internal mail system and outside deliveries and performed 
10913,other clerical duties. Four college students also worked intermittently 
10914,with the Administrative Office on a part-time or full-time basis during 
10915,the school year and summer vacations. 
10916,2. Budget. The Administrative Office also handled budget prepara- 
10917,tion and provided fiscal review and control of expenditures. WSPF's 
10918,"budget, which was included as part of the Department of Justice "
10919,"General Administration budget, and its actual expenditures for the "
10920,fiscal years (FY) in question were as follows: 1 
10921,Actual 
10922,Appropriation expenditures 
10923,"FY 1974 $2,800,000 $2,552,000 "
10924,"FY 1975 2, 865, 000 2, 625, 000 "
10925,"FY 1976 2 2,044,000 [request] 1 "
10926,Special Prosecutor Cox appeared before the Senate Subcommittee 
10927,on Appropriations in July of 1973 for his initial budget request of 90 
10928,"employees and $2,800,000 in funds to operate the office. This request "
10929,was prepared by the Department of Justice. The budgets for FY 1975 
10930,"and FY 1976, however, were prepared by WSPF itself. After final "
10931,"review by the Special Prosecutor, they were submitted to the Depart- "
10932,ment of Justice for inclusion in its overall budget request. 3 
10933,The largest expenditure for FY 1974 — apart from personnel 
10934,"salaries of $1,555,000 — was used to establish the office: these a start-up ,J "
10935,"costs included payments for furniture, equipment and office altera- "
10936,tions performed to meet stringent security requirements. The follow- 
10937,"ing year, staff salaries amounted to $1,750,000. Rent, communications "
10938,"costs and utilities averaged about $265,000 a year; security costs "
10939,"amounted to about $225,000 annually. The remaining expenditures "
10940,"were for travel, printing, supplies, machine rentals and court reporter "
10941,"services. A monthly report, reviewed by the Administrative Officer "
10942,"and the Special Prosecutor, was provided to the Justice Department "
10943,detailing expenditures for that month and year to date. As these figures 
10944,"indicate, the actual expenditures for each fiscal year were less than "
10945,the amount authorized. 
10946,3. Physical Facilities. When WSPF was first established in May 
10947,"1973, temporary quarters were made available in the office of the "
10948,"Assistant Attorney General for Administration. In early June, the "
10949,office moved into permanent space in a building at 1425 K Street NW. 
10950,"In August, additional office space was rented in the same building. "
10951,"1 Costs between May 25, 1973, and June 30, 1973, amounted to $250,000 "
10952,and were absorbed in the Justice Department General Administration budget. 
10953,2 The FY 1976 request for funds had to be submitted at an early date before 
10954,the date of termination of WSPF investigations could be projected. 
10955,3 Although the Attorney General had the power of final review over WSPF’s 
10956,"budget, the Special Prosecutor had almost complete authority over expenditures. "
10957,243
10958,"A total of 15,000 square feet was leased and furnished with basic "
10959,Government-issue furniture. 4 
10960,4. Security. The day-to-day security officer for WSPF was the 
10961,"Administrative Officer, with overall control and guidance provided "
10962,by the Justice Department. A special security director from the 
10963,Department was appointed to maintain the integrity of files and docu- 
10964,ments and to establish procedures to prevent unauthorized entry into 
10965,the office. The security director inspected the suite of offices selected 
10966,"for WSPF and advised on security construction requirements, the "
10967,"installation of electronic surveillance and fire detection systems, the "
10968,"guard services needed by the office, procedures to control access to "
10969,the office by both staff members and outsiders and methods of prevent- 
10970,ing interception of telephone communications and compromise of 
10971,documents. 
10972,Contractors were able to perform the necessary physical modifica- 
10973,tions to the office within two weeks of locating office space. Sound- 
10974,proofing was placed around all pipes and conduits entering the office 
10975,space. A closed-circuit television system was installed for observation 
10976,of the lobby area at the main entrance to the office. Alarms were at- 
10977,"tached to windows, doors and walls, and ultrasonic motion detectors "
10978,were placed in the Special Prosecutor's office and other key areas. 
10979,Officers of the Federal Protective Service provided around-the-clock 
10980,protection. A color-coded I.D. picture card system using a double 
10981,card exchange was used as a means of controlling employee and visitor 
10982,traffic. 5 Visitors were required to have an escort inside the offices at 
10983,all times. Security personnel performed periodic electronic sweeps of 
10984,office space and telephones. FBI background investigations for TOP 
10985,SECRET clearances were completed for all WSPF personnel. 
10986,4 The offices occupied portions of two floors with a law library located on 
10987,"another floor. In addition to its office space at 1425 K Street, the Special Prose- "
10988,"cutor had the use of several rooms in the U.S. District Courthouse, two of which "
10989,were used by Watergate grand juries and court reporters and the others by task 
10990,forces during trials. 
10991,5 All employees were required to surrender a photo badge when they entered 
10992,the office and to wear a specially coded photo badge while in the office.

11057,"In exercising this authority, the Special Prosecutor will have the greatest "
11058,degree of independence that is consistent with the Attorney General’s statutory 
11059,accountability for all matters falling within the jurisdiction of the Department of 
11060,Justice. The Attorney General will not countermand or interfere with the Special 
11061,Prosecutor’s decisions or actions. The Special Prosecutor will determine whether 
11062,and to what extent he will inform or consult with the Attorney General about 
11063,the conduct of his duties and responsibilities. The Special Prosecutor will not be 
11064,removed from his duties except for extraordinary improprieties on his part. 
11065,Staff and Resource Support

11337,Dear Mr. Jaworski: 
11338,"You have informed me that the amendment to your charter of November 19, "
11339,1973 has been questioned by some members of the press. This letter is to confirm 
11340,"what I told you in our telephone conversation. The amendment of November 19, "
11341,"1973 was intended to be, and is, a safeguard of your independence. "
11342,The President has given his assurance that he would not exercise his constitu- 
11343,tional powers either to discharge the Special Prosecutor or to limit the inde- 
11344,pendence of the Special Prosecutor without first consulting the Majority and 
11345,Minority leaders and chairmen and ranking members of the Judiciary Committees 
11346,"of the Senate and the House, and ascertaining that their consensus is in accord "
11347,with his proposed action. 
11348,"When that assurance was worked into the charter, the draftsman inadvertently "
11349,used a form of words that might have been construed as applying the President’s 
11350,assurance only to the subject of discharge. This was subsequently pointed out to 
11351,me by an assistant and I had the amendment of November 19 drafted in order 
11352,to put beyond question that the assurance given applied to your independence 
11353,under the charter and not merely to the subject of discharge. 
11354,"There is, in my judgment, no possibility whatever that the topics of discharge "
11355,or limitation of independence will ever be of more than hypothetical interest. I 
11356,write this letter only to repeat what you already know: the recent amendment 
11357,to your charter was to correct an ambiguous phrasing and thus to make clear 
11358,that the assurances concerning congressional consultation and consensus apply to 
11359,all aspects of your independence.
